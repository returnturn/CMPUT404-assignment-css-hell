<h1>WUTHERING HEIGHTS</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>1801.&mdash;I have just returned from a visit to my
landlord&mdash;the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled
with.&nbsp; This is certainly a beautiful country!&nbsp; In all
England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation
so completely removed from the stir of society.&nbsp; A perfect
misanthropist&rsquo;s heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a
suitable pair to divide the desolation between us.&nbsp; A
capital fellow!&nbsp; He little imagined how my heart warmed
towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously
under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered
themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his
waistcoat, as I announced my name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Heathcliff?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>A nod was the answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir.&nbsp; I do myself
the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival, to
express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my
perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange:
I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,&rsquo; he
interrupted, wincing.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should not allow any one to
inconvenience me, if I could hinder it&mdash;walk in!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;walk in&rsquo; was uttered with closed teeth, and
expressed the sentiment, &lsquo;Go to the Deuce:&rsquo; even the
gate over which he leant manifested no sympathising movement to
the words; and I think that circumstance determined me to accept
the invitation: I felt interested in a man who seemed more
exaggeratedly reserved than myself.</p>
<p>When he saw my horse&rsquo;s breast fairly pushing the
barrier, he did put out his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly
preceded me up the causeway, calling, as we entered the
court,&mdash;&lsquo;Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood&rsquo;s horse; and
bring up some wine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I
suppose,&rsquo; was the reflection suggested by this compound
order.&nbsp; &lsquo;No wonder the grass grows up between the
flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man: very old, perhaps,
though hale and sinewy.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Lord help us!&rsquo; he
soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure, while
relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime, in my face so sourly
that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to
digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no reference to
my unexpected advent.</p>
<p>Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff&rsquo;s
dwelling.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wuthering&rsquo; being a significant
provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to
which its station is exposed in stormy weather.&nbsp; Pure,
bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed:
one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge,
by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the
house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs
one way, as if craving alms of the sun.&nbsp; Happily, the
architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows
are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large
jutting stones.</p>
<p>Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of
grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about
the principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling
griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the date
&lsquo;1500,&rsquo; and the name &lsquo;Hareton
Earnshaw.&rsquo;&nbsp; I would have made a few comments, and
requested a short history of the place from the surly owner; but
his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance,
or complete departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his
impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.</p>
<p>One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any
introductory lobby or passage: they call it here &lsquo;the
house&rsquo; pre-eminently.&nbsp; It includes kitchen and
parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the
kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter: at
least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of
culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of
roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any
glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the
walls.&nbsp; One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and
heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with
silver jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak
dresser, to the very roof.&nbsp; The latter had never been
under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye,
except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of
legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it.&nbsp; Above the
chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of
horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily-painted
canisters disposed along its ledge.&nbsp; The floor was of
smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive
structures, painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in
the shade.&nbsp; In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge,
liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of squealing
puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.</p>
<p>The apartment and furniture would have been nothing
extraordinary as belonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a
stubborn countenance, and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in
knee-breeches and gaiters.&nbsp; Such an individual seated in his
arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him,
is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these
hills, if you go at the right time after dinner.&nbsp; But Mr.
Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of
living.&nbsp; He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and
manners a gentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a
country squire: rather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss
with his negligence, because he has an erect and handsome figure;
and rather morose.&nbsp; Possibly, some people might suspect him
of a degree of under-bred pride; I have a sympathetic chord
within that tells me it is nothing of the sort: I know, by
instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays
of feeling&mdash;to manifestations of mutual kindliness.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll love and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a
species of impertinence to be loved or hated again.&nbsp; No,
I&rsquo;m running on too fast: I bestow my own attributes
over-liberally on him.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely
dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he
meets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate me.&nbsp;
Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother
used to say I should never have a comfortable home; and only last
summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.</p>
<p>While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was
thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature: a real
goddess in my eyes, as long as she took no notice of me.&nbsp; I
&lsquo;never told my love&rsquo; vocally; still, if looks have
language, the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and
ears: she understood me at last, and looked a return&mdash;the
sweetest of all imaginable looks.&nbsp; And what did I do?&nbsp;
I confess it with shame&mdash;shrunk icily into myself, like a
snail; at every glance retired colder and farther; till finally
the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses, and,
overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake, persuaded her
mamma to decamp.&nbsp; By this curious turn of disposition I have
gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness; how
undeserved, I alone can appreciate.</p>
<p>I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that
towards which my landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of
silence by attempting to caress the canine mother, who had left
her nursery, and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs,
her lip curled up, and her white teeth watering for a
snatch.&nbsp; My caress provoked a long, guttural gnarl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better let the dog alone,&rsquo; growled
Mr. Heathcliff in unison, checking fiercer demonstrations with a
punch of his foot.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s not accustomed to be
spoiled&mdash;not kept for a pet.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, striding to
a side door, he shouted again, &lsquo;Joseph!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but
gave no intimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him,
leaving me <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the ruffianly bitch and a pair
of grim shaggy sheep-dogs, who shared with her a jealous
guardianship over all my movements.&nbsp; Not anxious to come in
contact with their fangs, I sat still; but, imagining they would
scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately indulged in
winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my
physiognomy so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a
fury and leapt on my knees.&nbsp; I flung her back, and hastened
to interpose the table between us.&nbsp; This proceeding aroused
the whole hive: half-a-dozen four-footed fiends, of various sizes
and ages, issued from hidden dens to the common centre.&nbsp; I
felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects of assault; and
parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with
the poker, I was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance from
some of the household in re-establishing peace.</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with
vexatious phlegm: I don&rsquo;t think they moved one second
faster than usual, though the hearth was an absolute tempest of
worrying and yelping.&nbsp; Happily, an inhabitant of the kitchen
made more despatch: a lusty dame, with tucked-up gown, bare arms,
and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the midst of us flourishing
a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her tongue, to such
purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she only
remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master
entered on the scene.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What the devil is the matter?&rsquo; he asked, eyeing
me in a manner that I could ill endure, after this inhospitable
treatment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What the devil, indeed!&rsquo; I muttered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The herd of possessed swine could have had no worse
spirits in them than those animals of yours, sir.&nbsp; You might
as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They won&rsquo;t meddle with persons who touch
nothing,&rsquo; he remarked, putting the bottle before me, and
restoring the displaced table.&nbsp; &lsquo;The dogs do right to
be vigilant.&nbsp; Take a glass of wine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not bitten, are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I had been, I would have set my signet on the
biter.&rsquo;&nbsp; Heathcliff&rsquo;s countenance relaxed into a
grin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you are flurried,
Mr. Lockwood.&nbsp; Here, take a little wine.&nbsp; Guests are so
exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs, I am willing
to own, hardly know how to receive them.&nbsp; Your health,
sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it
would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of
curs; besides, I felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement
at my expense; since his humour took that turn.&nbsp;
He&mdash;probably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly
of offending a good tenant&mdash;relaxed a little in the laconic
style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs, and
introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to
me,&mdash;a discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my
present place of retirement.&nbsp; I found him very intelligent
on the topics we touched; and before I went home, I was
encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to-morrow.&nbsp;
He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion.&nbsp; I shall
go, notwithstanding.&nbsp; It is astonishing how sociable I feel
myself compared with him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold.&nbsp; I had half a
mind to spend it by my study fire, instead of wading through
heath and mud to Wuthering Heights.&nbsp; On coming up from
dinner, however, (N.B.&mdash;I dine between twelve and one
o&rsquo;clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a
fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend
my request that I might be served at five)&mdash;on mounting the
stairs with this lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I
saw a servant-girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and
coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished
the flames with heaps of cinders.&nbsp; This spectacle drove me
back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles&rsquo;
walk, arrived at Heathcliff&rsquo;s garden-gate just in time to
escape the first feathery flakes of a snow-shower.</p>
<p>On that bleak hill-top the earth was hard with a black frost,
and the air made me shiver through every limb.&nbsp; Being unable
to remove the chain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged
causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked
vainly for admittance, till my knuckles tingled and the dogs
howled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wretched inmates!&rsquo; I ejaculated, mentally,
&lsquo;you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your
churlish inhospitality.&nbsp; At least, I would not keep my doors
barred in the day-time.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;I will get
in!&rsquo;&nbsp; So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it
vehemently.&nbsp; Vinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a
round window of the barn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are ye for?&rsquo; he shouted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;T&rsquo; maister&rsquo;s down i&rsquo; t&rsquo;
fowld.&nbsp; Go round by th&rsquo; end o&rsquo; t&rsquo; laith,
if ye went to spake to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there nobody inside to open the door?&rsquo; I
hallooed, responsively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nobbut t&rsquo; missis; and shoo&rsquo;ll
not oppen &rsquo;t an ye mak&rsquo; yer flaysome dins till
neeght.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&nbsp; Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh,
Joseph?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor-ne me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll hae no hend
wi&rsquo;t,&rsquo; muttered the head, vanishing.</p>
<p>The snow began to drive thickly.&nbsp; I seized the handle to
essay another trial; when a young man without coat, and
shouldering a pitchfork, appeared in the yard behind.&nbsp; He
hailed me to follow him, and, after marching through a
wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed, pump, and
pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful
apartment where I was formerly received.&nbsp; It glowed
delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire, compounded of
coal, peat, and wood; and near the table, laid for a plentiful
evening meal, I was pleased to observe the &lsquo;missis,&rsquo;
an individual whose existence I had never previously
suspected.&nbsp; I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me
take a seat.&nbsp; She looked at me, leaning back in her chair,
and remained motionless and mute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rough weather!&rsquo; I remarked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door must bear the
consequence of your servants&rsquo; leisure attendance: I had
hard work to make them hear me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She never opened her mouth.&nbsp; I stared&mdash;she stared
also: at any rate, she kept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless
manner, exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sit down,&rsquo; said the young man, gruffly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be in soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who
deigned, at this second interview, to move the extreme tip of her
tail, in token of owning my acquaintance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A beautiful animal!&rsquo; I commenced again.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Do you intend parting with the little ones,
madam?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are not mine,&rsquo; said the amiable hostess,
more repellingly than Heathcliff himself could have replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, your favourites are among these?&rsquo; I
continued, turning to an obscure cushion full of something like
cats.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A strange choice of favourites!&rsquo; she observed
scornfully.</p>
<p>Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits.&nbsp; I hemmed once
more, and drew closer to the hearth, repeating my comment on the
wildness of the evening.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should not have come out,&rsquo; she said, rising
and reaching from the chimney-piece two of the painted
canisters.</p>
<p>Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a
distinct view of her whole figure and countenance.&nbsp; She was
slender, and apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable
form, and the most exquisite little face that I have ever had the
pleasure of beholding; small features, very fair; flaxen
ringlets, or rather golden, hanging loose on her delicate neck;
and eyes, had they been agreeable in expression, that would have
been irresistible: fortunately for my susceptible heart, the only
sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a kind of
desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there.&nbsp; The
canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to aid
her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one
attempted to assist him in counting his gold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want your help,&rsquo; she snapped;
&lsquo;I can get them for myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon!&rsquo; I hastened to reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you asked to tea?&rsquo; she demanded, tying an
apron over her neat black frock, and standing with a spoonful of
the leaf poised over the pot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be glad to have a cup,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you asked?&rsquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said, half smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are
the proper person to ask me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair
in a pet; her forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed
out, like a child&rsquo;s ready to cry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a
decidedly shabby upper garment, and, erecting himself before the
blaze, looked down on me from the corner of his eyes, for all the
world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between
us.&nbsp; I began to doubt whether he were a servant or not: his
dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of the
superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick
brown curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached
bearishly over his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like
those of a common labourer: still his bearing was free, almost
haughty, and he showed none of a domestic&rsquo;s assiduity in
attending on the lady of the house.&nbsp; In the absence of clear
proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to abstain from
noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes afterwards, the
entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure, from my
uncomfortable state.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!&rsquo; I
exclaimed, assuming the cheerful; &lsquo;and I fear I shall be
weather-bound for half an hour, if you can afford me shelter
during that space.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Half an hour?&rsquo; he said, shaking the white flakes
from his clothes; &lsquo;I wonder you should select the thick of
a snow-storm to ramble about in.&nbsp; Do you know that you run a
risk of being lost in the marshes?&nbsp; People familiar with
these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I can
tell you there is no chance of a change at present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might
stay at the Grange till morning&mdash;could you spare me
one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I could not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, indeed!&nbsp; Well, then, I must trust to my own
sagacity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Umph!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you going to mak&rsquo; the tea?&rsquo; demanded he
of the shabby coat, shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the
young lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is <i>he</i> to have any?&rsquo; she asked, appealing
to Heathcliff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get it ready, will you?&rsquo; was the answer, uttered
so savagely that I started.&nbsp; The tone in which the words
were said revealed a genuine bad nature.&nbsp; I no longer felt
inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow.&nbsp; When the
preparations were finished, he invited me with&mdash;&lsquo;Now,
sir, bring forward your chair.&rsquo;&nbsp; And we all, including
the rustic youth, drew round the table: an austere silence
prevailing while we discussed our meal.</p>
<p>I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make
an effort to dispel it.&nbsp; They could not every day sit so
grim and taciturn; and it was impossible, however ill-tempered
they might be, that the universal scowl they wore was their
every-day countenance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is strange,&rsquo; I began, in the interval of
swallowing one cup of tea and receiving another&mdash;&lsquo;it
is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas: many could
not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete
exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff; yet,
I&rsquo;ll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and
with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and
heart&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My amiable lady!&rsquo; he interrupted, with an almost
diabolical sneer on his face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is she&mdash;my
amiable lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes&mdash;oh, you would intimate that her spirit
has taken the post of ministering angel, and guards the fortunes
of Wuthering Heights, even when her body is gone.&nbsp; Is that
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct
it.&nbsp; I might have seen there was too great a disparity
between the ages of the parties to make it likely that they were
man and wife.&nbsp; One was about forty: a period of mental
vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being married
for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace of our
declining years.&nbsp; The other did not look seventeen.</p>
<p>Then it flashed upon me&mdash;&lsquo;The clown at my elbow, who
is drinking his tea out of a basin and eating his bread with
unwashed hands, may be her husband: Heathcliff junior, of
course.&nbsp; Here is the consequence of being buried alive: she
has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer ignorance that
better individuals existed!&nbsp; A sad pity&mdash;I must beware
how I cause her to regret her choice.&rsquo;&nbsp; The last
reflection may seem conceited; it was not.&nbsp; My neighbour
struck me as bordering on repulsive; I knew, through experience,
that I was tolerably attractive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,&rsquo; said
Heathcliff, corroborating my surmise.&nbsp; He turned, as he
spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a look of hatred; unless
he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that will not, like
those of other people, interpret the language of his soul.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, certainly&mdash;I see now: you are the favoured
possessor of the beneficent fairy,&rsquo; I remarked, turning to
my neighbour.</p>
<p>This was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and
clenched his fist, with every appearance of a meditated
assault.&nbsp; But he seemed to recollect himself presently, and
smothered the storm in a brutal curse, muttered on my behalf:
which, however, I took care not to notice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,&rsquo; observed my
host; &lsquo;we neither of us have the privilege of owning your
good fairy; her mate is dead.&nbsp; I said she was my
daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my
son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And this young man is&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not my son, assuredly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest
to attribute the paternity of that bear to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My name is Hareton Earnshaw,&rsquo; growled the other;
&lsquo;and I&rsquo;d counsel you to respect it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve shown no disrespect,&rsquo; was my reply,
laughing internally at the dignity with which he announced
himself.</p>
<p>He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the
stare, for fear I might be tempted either to box his ears or
render my hilarity audible.&nbsp; I began to feel unmistakably
out of place in that pleasant family circle.&nbsp; The dismal
spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than neutralised, the
glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to be cautious
how I ventured under those rafters a third time.</p>
<p>The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a
word of sociable conversation, I approached a window to examine
the weather.&nbsp; A sorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming
down prematurely, and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl
of wind and suffocating snow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it possible for me to get home now
without a guide,&rsquo; I could not help exclaiming.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The roads will be buried already; and, if they were bare,
I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn
porch.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll be covered if left in the fold all
night: and put a plank before them,&rsquo; said Heathcliff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How must I do?&rsquo; I continued, with rising
irritation.</p>
<p>There was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw
only Joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs.
Heathcliff leaning over the fire, diverting herself with burning
a bundle of matches which had fallen from the chimney-piece as
she restored the tea-canister to its place.&nbsp; The former,
when he had deposited his burden, took a critical survey of the
room, and in cracked tones grated out&mdash;&lsquo;Aw wonder how
yah can faishion to stand thear i&rsquo; idleness un war, when
all on &rsquo;ems goan out!&nbsp; Bud yah&rsquo;re a nowt, and
it&rsquo;s no use talking&mdash;yah&rsquo;ll niver mend
o&rsquo;yer ill ways, but goa raight to t&rsquo; divil, like yer
mother afore ye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was
addressed to me; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the
aged rascal with an intention of kicking him out of the
door.&nbsp; Mrs. Heathcliff, however, checked me by her
answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You scandalous old hypocrite!&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Are you not afraid of being carried away bodily, whenever
you mention the devil&rsquo;s name?&nbsp; I warn you to refrain
from provoking me, or I&rsquo;ll ask your abduction as a special
favour!&nbsp; Stop! look here, Joseph,&rsquo; she continued,
taking a long, dark book from a shelf; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll show you
how far I&rsquo;ve progressed in the Black Art: I shall soon be
competent to make a clear house of it.&nbsp; The red cow
didn&rsquo;t die by chance; and your rheumatism can hardly be
reckoned among providential visitations!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, wicked, wicked!&rsquo; gasped the elder; &lsquo;may
the Lord deliver us from evil!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, reprobate! you are a castaway&mdash;be off, or
I&rsquo;ll hurt you seriously!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have you all
modelled in wax and clay! and the first who passes the limits I
fix shall&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not say what he shall be done
to&mdash;but, you&rsquo;ll see!&nbsp; Go, I&rsquo;m looking at
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes,
and Joseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying,
and ejaculating &lsquo;wicked&rsquo; as he went.&nbsp; I thought
her conduct must be prompted by a species of dreary fun; and, now
that we were alone, I endeavoured to interest her in my
distress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Heathcliff,&rsquo; I said earnestly, &lsquo;you
must excuse me for troubling you.&nbsp; I presume, because, with
that face, I&rsquo;m sure you cannot help being
good-hearted.&nbsp; Do point out some landmarks by which I may
know my way home: I have no more idea how to get there than you
would have how to get to London!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take the road you came,&rsquo; she answered, ensconcing
herself in a chair, with a candle, and the long book open before
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is brief advice, but as sound as I can
give.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog
or a pit full of snow, your conscience won&rsquo;t whisper that
it is partly your fault?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How so?&nbsp; I cannot escort you.&nbsp; They
wouldn&rsquo;t let me go to the end of the garden
wall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>You</i>!&nbsp; I should be sorry to ask you to cross
the threshold, for my convenience, on such a night,&rsquo; I
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want you to tell me my way, not to
<i>show</i> it: or else to persuade Mr. Heathcliff to give me a
guide.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&nbsp; There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph
and I.&nbsp; Which would you have?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are there no boys at the farm?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; those are all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, it follows that I am compelled to
stay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That you may settle with your host.&nbsp; I have
nothing to do with it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash
journeys on these hills,&rsquo; cried Heathcliff&rsquo;s stern
voice from the kitchen entrance.&nbsp; &lsquo;As to staying here,
I don&rsquo;t keep accommodations for visitors: you must share a
bed with Hareton or Joseph, if you do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can sleep on a chair in this room,&rsquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no!&nbsp; A stranger is a stranger, be he rich or
poor: it will not suit me to permit any one the range of the
place while I am off guard!&rsquo; said the unmannerly
wretch.</p>
<p>With this insult my patience was at an end.&nbsp; I uttered an
expression of disgust, and pushed past him into the yard, running
against Earnshaw in my haste.&nbsp; It was so dark that I could
not see the means of exit; and, as I wandered round, I heard
another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each
other.&nbsp; At first the young man appeared about to befriend
me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go with him as far as the park,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll go with him to hell!&rsquo; exclaimed his
master, or whatever relation he bore.&nbsp; &lsquo;And who is to
look after the horses, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man&rsquo;s life is of more consequence than one
evening&rsquo;s neglect of the horses: somebody must go,&rsquo;
murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I expected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at your command!&rsquo; retorted Hareton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If you set store on him, you&rsquo;d better be
quiet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr.
Heathcliff will never get another tenant till the Grange is a
ruin,&rsquo; she answered, sharply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hearken, hearken, shoo&rsquo;s cursing on
&rsquo;em!&rsquo; muttered Joseph, towards whom I had been
steering.</p>
<p>He sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a
lantern, which I seized unceremoniously, and, calling out that I
would send it back on the morrow, rushed to the nearest
postern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maister, maister, he&rsquo;s staling t&rsquo;
lanthern!&rsquo; shouted the ancient, pursuing my retreat.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hey, Gnasher!&nbsp; Hey, dog!&nbsp; Hey Wolf, holld him,
holld him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>On opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my
throat, bearing me down, and extinguishing the light; while a
mingled guffaw from Heathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on
my rage and humiliation.&nbsp; Fortunately, the beasts seemed
more bent on stretching their paws, and yawning, and flourishing
their tails, than devouring me alive; but they would suffer no
resurrection, and I was forced to lie till their malignant
masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and trembling with
wrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out&mdash;on their
peril to keep me one minute longer&mdash;with several incoherent
threats of retaliation that, in their indefinite depth of
virulency, smacked of King Lear.</p>
<p>The vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at
the nose, and still Heathcliff laughed, and still I
scolded.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what would have concluded the
scene, had there not been one person at hand rather more rational
than myself, and more benevolent than my entertainer.&nbsp; This
was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued forth to
inquire into the nature of the uproar.&nbsp; She thought that
some of them had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring
to attack her master, she turned her vocal artillery against the
younger scoundrel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mr. Earnshaw,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;I wonder
what you&rsquo;ll have agait next?&nbsp; Are we going to murder
folk on our very door-stones?&nbsp; I see this house will never
do for me&mdash;look at t&rsquo; poor lad, he&rsquo;s fair
choking!&nbsp; Wisht, wisht; you mun&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go on
so.&nbsp; Come in, and I&rsquo;ll cure that: there now, hold ye
still.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water
down my neck, and pulled me into the kitchen.&nbsp; Mr.
Heathcliff followed, his accidental merriment expiring quickly in
his habitual moroseness.</p>
<p>I was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and thus
compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof.&nbsp; He
told Zillah to give me a glass of brandy, and then passed on to
the inner room; while she condoled with me on my sorry
predicament, and having obeyed his orders, whereby I was somewhat
revived, ushered me to bed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>While leading the way upstairs, she recommended that I should
hide the candle, and not make a noise; for her master had an odd
notion about the chamber she would put me in, and never let
anybody lodge there willingly.&nbsp; I asked the reason.&nbsp;
She did not know, she answered: she had only lived there a year
or two; and they had so many queer goings on, she could not begin
to be curious.</p>
<p>Too stupefied to be curious myself, I fastened my door and
glanced round for the bed.&nbsp; The whole furniture consisted of
a chair, a clothes-press, and a large oak case, with squares cut
out near the top resembling coach windows.&nbsp; Having
approached this structure, I looked inside, and perceived it to
be a singular sort of old-fashioned couch, very conveniently
designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family
having a room to himself.&nbsp; In fact, it formed a little
closet, and the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a
table.&nbsp; I slid back the panelled sides, got in with my
light, pulled them together again, and felt secure against the
vigilance of Heathcliff, and every one else.</p>
<p>The ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books
piled up in one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched
on the paint.&nbsp; This writing, however, was nothing but a name
repeated in all kinds of characters, large and
small&mdash;<i>Catherine Earnshaw</i>, here and there varied to
<i>Catherine Heathcliff</i>, and then again to <i>Catherine
Linton</i>.</p>
<p>In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and
continued spelling over Catherine
Earnshaw&mdash;Heathcliff&mdash;Linton, till my eyes closed; but
they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters
started from the dark, as vivid as spectres&mdash;the air swarmed
with Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name,
I discovered my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique
volumes, and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted
calf-skin.&nbsp; I snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease under
the influence of cold and lingering nausea, sat up and spread
open the injured tome on my knee.&nbsp; It was a Testament, in
lean type, and smelling dreadfully musty: a fly-leaf bore the
inscription&mdash;&lsquo;Catherine Earnshaw, her book,&rsquo; and
a date some quarter of a century back.&nbsp; I shut it, and took
up another and another, till I had examined all.&nbsp;
Catherine&rsquo;s library was select, and its state of
dilapidation proved it to have been well used, though not
altogether for a legitimate purpose: scarcely one chapter had
escaped, a pen-and-ink commentary&mdash;at least the appearance
of one&mdash;covering every morsel of blank that the printer had
left.&nbsp; Some were detached sentences; other parts took the
form of a regular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish
hand.&nbsp; At the top of an extra page (quite a treasure,
probably, when first lighted on) I was greatly amused to behold
an excellent caricature of my friend Joseph,&mdash;rudely, yet
powerfully sketched.&nbsp; An immediate interest kindled within
me for the unknown Catherine, and I began forthwith to decipher
her faded hieroglyphics.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An awful Sunday,&rsquo; commenced the paragraph
beneath.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish my father were back again.&nbsp;
Hindley is a detestable substitute&mdash;his conduct to
Heathcliff is atrocious&mdash;H. and I are going to
rebel&mdash;we took our initiatory step this evening.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All day had been flooding with rain; we could not go to
church, so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret;
and, while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a
comfortable fire&mdash;doing anything but reading their Bibles,
I&rsquo;ll answer for it&mdash;Heathcliff, myself, and the
unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer-books, and
mount: we were ranged in a row, on a sack of corn, groaning and
shivering, and hoping that Joseph would shiver too, so that he
might give us a short homily for his own sake.&nbsp; A vain
idea!&nbsp; The service lasted precisely three hours; and yet my
brother had the face to exclaim, when he saw us descending,
&ldquo;What, done already?&rdquo;&nbsp; On Sunday evenings we
used to be permitted to play, if we did not make much noise; now
a mere titter is sufficient to send us into corners.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You forget you have a master here,&rdquo; says
the tyrant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll demolish the first who puts
me out of temper!&nbsp; I insist on perfect sobriety and
silence.&nbsp; Oh, boy! was that you?&nbsp; Frances darling, pull
his hair as you go by: I heard him snap his fingers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Frances pulled his hair heartily, and then went and seated
herself on her husband&rsquo;s knee, and there they were, like
two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the
hour&mdash;foolish palaver that we should be ashamed of.&nbsp; We
made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the
dresser.&nbsp; I had just fastened our pinafores together, and
hung them up for a curtain, when in comes Joseph, on an errand
from the stables.&nbsp; He tears down my handiwork, boxes my
ears, and croaks:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;T&rsquo; maister nobbut just buried, and Sabbath
not o&rsquo;ered, und t&rsquo; sound o&rsquo; t&rsquo; gospel
still i&rsquo; yer lugs, and ye darr be laiking!&nbsp; Shame on
ye! sit ye down, ill childer! there&rsquo;s good books eneugh if
ye&rsquo;ll read &rsquo;em: sit ye down, and think o&rsquo; yer
sowls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Saying this, he compelled us so to square our positions
that we might receive from the far-off fire a dull ray to show us
the text of the lumber he thrust upon us.&nbsp; I could not bear
the employment.&nbsp; I took my dingy volume by the scroop, and
hurled it into the dog-kennel, vowing I hated a good book.&nbsp;
Heathcliff kicked his to the same place.&nbsp; Then there was a
hubbub!</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Maister Hindley!&rdquo; shouted our
chaplain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maister, coom hither!&nbsp; Miss
Cathy&rsquo;s riven th&rsquo; back off &lsquo;Th&rsquo; Helmet
o&rsquo; Salvation,&rsquo; un&rsquo; Heathcliff&rsquo;s pawsed
his fit into t&rsquo; first part o&rsquo; &lsquo;T&rsquo; Brooad
Way to Destruction!&rsquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s fair flaysome that ye
let &rsquo;em go on this gait.&nbsp; Ech! th&rsquo; owd man wad
ha&rsquo; laced &rsquo;em properly&mdash;but he&rsquo;s
goan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth, and
seizing one of us by the collar, and the other by the arm, hurled
both into the back-kitchen; where, Joseph asseverated, &ldquo;owd
Nick&rdquo; would fetch us as sure as we were living: and, so comforted,
we each sought a separate nook to await his advent.&nbsp; I
reached this book, and a pot of ink from a shelf, and pushed the
house-door ajar to give me light, and I have got the time on with
writing for twenty minutes; but my companion is impatient, and
proposes that we should appropriate the dairywoman&rsquo;s cloak,
and have a scamper on the moors, under its shelter.&nbsp; A
pleasant suggestion&mdash;and then, if the surly old man come in,
he may believe his prophecy verified&mdash;we cannot be damper,
or colder, in the rain than we are here.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project, for the next
sentence took up another subject: she waxed lachrymose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me
cry so!&rsquo; she wrote.&nbsp; &lsquo;My head aches, till I
cannot keep it on the pillow; and still I can&rsquo;t give
over.&nbsp; Poor Heathcliff!&nbsp; Hindley calls him a vagabond,
and won&rsquo;t let him sit with us, nor eat with us any more;
and, he says, he and I must not play together, and threatens to
turn him out of the house if we break his orders.&nbsp; He has
been blaming our father (how dared he?) for treating H. too
liberally; and swears he will reduce him to his right
place&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>I began to nod drowsily over the dim page: my eye wandered
from manuscript to print.&nbsp; I saw a red ornamented
title&mdash;&lsquo;Seventy Times Seven, and the First of the
Seventy-First. A Pious Discourse delivered by the
Reverend Jabez Branderham, in the Chapel of Gimmerden
Sough.&rsquo;&nbsp; And while I was, half-consciously, worrying
my brain to guess what Jabez Branderham would make of his
subject, I sank back in bed, and fell asleep.&nbsp; Alas, for the
effects of bad tea and bad temper!&nbsp; What else could it be
that made me pass such a terrible night?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was
capable of suffering.</p>
<p>I began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my
locality.&nbsp; I thought it was morning; and I had set out on my
way home, with Joseph for a guide.&nbsp; The snow lay yards deep
in our road; and, as we floundered on, my companion wearied me
with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrim&rsquo;s
staff: telling me that I could never get into the house without
one, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel, which I
understood to be so denominated.&nbsp; For a moment I considered
it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance
into my own residence.&nbsp; Then a new idea flashed across
me.&nbsp; I was not going there: we were journeying to hear the
famous Jabez Branderham preach, from the
text&mdash;&lsquo;Seventy Times Seven;&rsquo; and either Joseph,
the preacher, or I had committed the &lsquo;First of the
Seventy-First,&rsquo; and were to be publicly exposed and
excommunicated.</p>
<p>We came to the chapel.&nbsp; I have passed it really in my
walks, twice or thrice; it lies in a hollow, between two hills:
an elevated hollow, near a swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to
answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited
there.&nbsp; The roof has been kept whole hitherto; but as the
clergyman&rsquo;s stipend is only twenty pounds per annum, and a
house with two rooms, threatening speedily to determine into one,
no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor: especially as
it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him
starve than increase the living by one penny from their own
pockets.&nbsp; However, in my dream, Jabez had a full and
attentive congregation; and he preached&mdash;good God! what a
sermon; divided into <i>four hundred and ninety</i> parts, each
fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit, and each
discussing a separate sin!&nbsp; Where he searched for them, I
cannot tell.&nbsp; He had his private manner of interpreting the
phrase, and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different
sins on every occasion.&nbsp; They were of the most curious
character: odd transgressions that I never imagined
previously.</p>
<p>Oh, how weary I grow.&nbsp; How I writhed, and yawned, and
nodded, and revived!&nbsp; How I pinched and pricked myself, and
rubbed my eyes, and stood up, and sat down again, and nudged
Joseph to inform me if he would <i>ever</i> have done.&nbsp; I
was condemned to hear all out: finally, he reached the
&lsquo;<i>First of the Seventy-First</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; At that
crisis, a sudden inspiration descended on me; I was moved to rise
and denounce Jabez Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no
Christian need pardon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;sitting here within
these four walls, at one stretch, I have endured and forgiven the
four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse.&nbsp; Seventy
times seven times have I plucked up my hat and been about to
depart&mdash;Seventy times seven times have you preposterously
forced me to resume my seat.&nbsp; The four hundred and
ninety-first is too much.&nbsp; Fellow-martyrs, have at
him!&nbsp; Drag him down, and crush him to atoms, that the place
which knows him may know him no more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Thou art the Man</i>!&rsquo; cried Jabez, after a
solemn pause, leaning over his cushion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Seventy
times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy
visage&mdash;seventy times seven did I take counsel with my
soul&mdash;Lo, this is human weakness: this also may be
absolved!&nbsp; The First of the Seventy-First is come.&nbsp;
Brethren, execute upon him the judgment written.&nbsp; Such
honour have all His saints!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their
pilgrim&rsquo;s staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having
no weapon to raise in self-defence, commenced grappling with
Joseph, my nearest and most ferocious assailant, for his.&nbsp;
In the confluence of the multitude, several clubs crossed; blows,
aimed at me, fell on other sconces.&nbsp; Presently the whole
chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings: every
man&rsquo;s hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham,
unwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of
loud taps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly
that, at last, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me.&nbsp; And
what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult?&nbsp; What
had played Jabez&rsquo;s part in the row?&nbsp; Merely the branch
of a fir-tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by, and
rattled its dry cones against the panes!&nbsp; I listened
doubtingly an instant; detected the disturber, then turned and
dozed, and dreamt again: if possible, still more disagreeably
than before.</p>
<p>This time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I
heard distinctly the gusty wind, and the driving of the snow; I
heard, also, the fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed
it to the right cause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved
to silence it, if possible; and, I thought, I rose and
endeavoured to unhasp the casement.&nbsp; The hook was soldered
into the staple: a circumstance observed by me when awake, but
forgotten.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must stop it, nevertheless!&rsquo; I
muttered, knocking my knuckles through the glass, and stretching
an arm out to seize the importunate branch; instead of which, my
fingers closed on the fingers of a little, ice-cold hand!&nbsp;
The intense horror of nightmare came over me: I tried to draw
back my arm, but the hand clung to it, and a most melancholy
voice sobbed, &lsquo;Let me in&mdash;let me in!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; I asked, struggling, meanwhile, to
disengage myself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Catherine Linton,&rsquo; it
replied, shiveringly (why did I think of <i>Linton</i>?&nbsp; I
had read <i>Earnshaw</i> twenty times for
Linton)&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m come home: I&rsquo;d lost my way
on the moor!&rsquo;&nbsp; As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a
child&rsquo;s face looking through the window.&nbsp; Terror made
me cruel; and, finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature
off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane, and rubbed it to
and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes: still
it wailed, &lsquo;Let me in!&rsquo; and maintained its tenacious
grip, almost maddening me with fear.&nbsp; &lsquo;How can
I!&rsquo; I said at length.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let <i>me</i> go, if you
want me to let you in!&rsquo;&nbsp; The fingers relaxed, I
snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled the books up in a
pyramid against it, and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable
prayer.&nbsp; I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an
hour; yet, the instant I listened again, there was the doleful
cry moaning on!&nbsp; &lsquo;Begone!&rsquo; I shouted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty
years.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It is twenty years,&rsquo; mourned the
voice: &lsquo;twenty years.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been a waif for
twenty years!&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereat began a feeble scratching
outside, and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward.&nbsp;
I tried to jump up; but could not stir a limb; and so yelled
aloud, in a frenzy of fright.&nbsp; To my confusion, I discovered
the yell was not ideal: hasty footsteps approached my chamber
door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous hand, and a light
glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed.&nbsp; I sat
shuddering yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead: the
intruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself.&nbsp; At
last, he said, in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an
answer, &lsquo;Is any one here?&rsquo;&nbsp; I considered it best
to confess my presence; for I knew Heathcliff&rsquo;s accents,
and feared he might search further, if I kept quiet.&nbsp; With
this intention, I turned and opened the panels.&nbsp; I shall not
soon forget the effect my action produced.</p>
<p>Heathcliff stood near the entrance, in his shirt and trousers;
with a candle dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as
the wall behind him.&nbsp; The first creak of the oak startled
him like an electric shock: the light leaped from his hold to a
distance of some feet, and his agitation was so extreme, that he
could hardly pick it up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is only your guest, sir,&rsquo; I called out,
desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice
further.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had the misfortune to scream in my sleep,
owing to a frightful nightmare.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry I disturbed
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood!&nbsp; I wish you
were at the&mdash;&rsquo; commenced my host, setting the candle
on a chair, because he found it impossible to hold it
steady.&nbsp; &lsquo;And who showed you up into this room?&rsquo;
he continued, crushing his nails into his palms, and grinding his
teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who was
it?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a good mind to turn them out of the house
this moment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was your servant Zillah,&rsquo; I replied, flinging
myself on to the floor, and rapidly resuming my garments.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I should not care if you did, Mr. Heathcliff; she richly
deserves it.&nbsp; I suppose that she wanted to get another proof
that the place was haunted, at my expense.&nbsp; Well, it
is&mdash;swarming with ghosts and goblins!&nbsp; You have reason
in shutting it up, I assure you.&nbsp; No one will thank you for
a doze in such a den!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; asked Heathcliff, &lsquo;and
what are you doing?&nbsp; Lie down and finish out the night,
since you <i>are</i> here; but, for heaven&rsquo;s sake!
don&rsquo;t repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it,
unless you were having your throat cut!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If the little fiend had got in at the window, she
probably would have strangled me!&rsquo; I returned.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to endure the persecutions of your
hospitable ancestors again.&nbsp; Was not the Reverend Jabez
Branderham akin to you on the mother&rsquo;s side?&nbsp; And that
minx, Catherine Linton, or Earnshaw, or however she was
called&mdash;she must have been a changeling&mdash;wicked little
soul!&nbsp; She told me she had been walking the earth these
twenty years: a just punishment for her mortal transgressions,
I&rsquo;ve no doubt!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the
association of Heathcliff&rsquo;s with Catherine&rsquo;s name in
the book, which had completely slipped from my memory, till thus
awakened.&nbsp; I blushed at my inconsideration: but, without
showing further consciousness of the offence, I hastened to
add&mdash;&lsquo;The truth is, sir, I passed the first part of
the night in&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; Here I stopped afresh&mdash;I
was about to say &lsquo;perusing those old volumes,&rsquo; then
it would have revealed my knowledge of their written, as well as
their printed, contents; so, correcting myself, I went
on&mdash;&lsquo;in spelling over the name scratched on that
window-ledge.&nbsp; A monotonous occupation, calculated to set me
asleep, like counting, or&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What <i>can</i> you mean by talking in this way to
<i>me</i>!&rsquo; thundered Heathcliff with savage
vehemence.&nbsp; &lsquo;How&mdash;how <i>dare</i> you, under my
roof?&mdash;God! he&rsquo;s mad to speak so!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he
struck his forehead with rage.</p>
<p>I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my
explanation; but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took
pity and proceeded with my dreams; affirming I had never heard
the appellation of &lsquo;Catherine Linton&rsquo; before, but
reading it often over produced an impression which personified
itself when I had no longer my imagination under control.&nbsp;
Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed, as I
spoke; finally sitting down almost concealed behind it.&nbsp; I
guessed, however, by his irregular and intercepted breathing,
that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion.&nbsp;
Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict, I continued
my toilette rather noisily, looked at my watch, and soliloquised
on the length of the night: &lsquo;Not three o&rsquo;clock
yet!&nbsp; I could have taken oath it had been six.&nbsp; Time
stagnates here: we must surely have retired to rest at
eight!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Always at nine in winter, and rise at four,&rsquo; said
my host, suppressing a groan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of
his arm&rsquo;s shadow, dashing a tear from his eyes.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mr. Lockwood,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;you may go into my
room: you&rsquo;ll only be in the way, coming down-stairs so
early: and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And for me, too,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll walk in the yard till daylight, and then
I&rsquo;ll be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my
intrusion.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in
society, be it country or town.&nbsp; A sensible man ought to
find sufficient company in himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Delightful company!&rsquo; muttered Heathcliff.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Take the candle, and go where you please.&nbsp; I shall
join you directly.&nbsp; Keep out of the yard, though, the dogs
are unchained; and the house&mdash;Juno mounts sentinel there,
and&mdash;nay, you can only ramble about the steps and
passages.&nbsp; But, away with you!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come in two
minutes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where
the narrow lobbies led, I stood still, and was witness,
involuntarily, to a piece of superstition on the part of my
landlord which belied, oddly, his apparent sense.&nbsp; He got on
to the bed, and wrenched open the lattice, bursting, as he pulled
at it, into an uncontrollable passion of tears.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come
in! come in!&rsquo; he sobbed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cathy, do come.&nbsp;
Oh, do&mdash;<i>once</i> more!&nbsp; Oh! my heart&rsquo;s
darling! hear me <i>this</i> time, Catherine, at
last!&rsquo;&nbsp; The spectre showed a spectre&rsquo;s ordinary
caprice: it gave no sign of being; but the snow and wind whirled
wildly through, even reaching my station, and blowing out the
light.</p>
<p>There was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied
this raving, that my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I
drew off, half angry to have listened at all, and vexed at having
related my ridiculous nightmare, since it produced that agony;
though <i>why</i> was beyond my comprehension.&nbsp; I descended
cautiously to the lower regions, and landed in the back-kitchen,
where a gleam of fire, raked compactly together, enabled me to
rekindle my candle.&nbsp; Nothing was stirring except a brindled,
grey cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a
querulous mew.</p>
<p>Two benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed
the hearth; on one of these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin
mounted the other.&nbsp; We were both of us nodding ere any one
invaded our retreat, and then it was Joseph, shuffling down a
wooden ladder that vanished in the roof, through a trap: the
ascent to his garret, I suppose.&nbsp; He cast a sinister look at
the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs,
swept the cat from its elevation, and bestowing himself in the
vacancy, commenced the operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe
with tobacco.&nbsp; My presence in his sanctum was evidently
esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark: he
silently applied the tube to his lips, folded his arms, and
puffed away.&nbsp; I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed; and
after sucking out his last wreath, and heaving a profound sigh,
he got up, and departed as solemnly as he came.</p>
<p>A more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my
mouth for a &lsquo;good-morning,&rsquo; but closed it again, the
salutation unachieved; for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his
orison <i>sotto voce</i>, in a series of curses directed against
every object he touched, while he rummaged a corner for a spade
or shovel to dig through the drifts.&nbsp; He glanced over the
back of the bench, dilating his nostrils, and thought as little
of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the
cat.&nbsp; I guessed, by his preparations, that egress was
allowed, and, leaving my hard couch, made a movement to follow
him.&nbsp; He noticed this, and thrust at an inner door with the
end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate sound that there
was the place where I must go, if I changed my locality.</p>
<p>It opened into the house, where the females were already
astir; Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a
colossal bellows; and Mrs. Heathcliff, kneeling on the hearth,
reading a book by the aid of the blaze.&nbsp; She held her hand
interposed between the furnace-heat and her eyes, and seemed
absorbed in her occupation; desisting from it only to chide the
servant for covering her with sparks, or to push away a dog, now
and then, that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her
face.&nbsp; I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also.&nbsp;
He stood by the fire, his back towards me, just finishing a
stormy scene with poor Zillah; who ever and anon interrupted her
labour to pluck up the corner of her apron, and heave an
indignant groan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you, you worthless&mdash;&rsquo; he broke out as I
entered, turning to his daughter-in-law, and employing an epithet
as harmless as duck, or sheep, but generally represented by a
dash&mdash;.&nbsp; &lsquo;There you are, at your idle tricks
again!&nbsp; The rest of them do earn their bread&mdash;you live
on my charity!&nbsp; Put your trash away, and find something to
do.&nbsp; You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally
in my sight&mdash;do you hear, damnable jade?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll put my trash away, because you can make me
if I refuse,&rsquo; answered the young lady, closing her book,
and throwing it on a chair.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll not do
anything, though you should swear your tongue out, except what I
please!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff lifted his hand, and the speaker sprang to a safer
distance, obviously acquainted with its weight.&nbsp; Having no
desire to be entertained by a cat-and-dog combat, I stepped
forward briskly, as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth,
and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute.&nbsp;
Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities:
Heathcliff placed his fists, out of temptation, in his pockets;
Mrs. Heathcliff curled her lip, and walked to a seat far off,
where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during
the remainder of my stay.&nbsp; That was not long.&nbsp; I
declined joining their breakfast, and, at the first gleam of
dawn, took an opportunity of escaping into the free air, now
clear, and still, and cold as impalpable ice.</p>
<p>My landlord halloed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of
the garden, and offered to accompany me across the moor.&nbsp; It
was well he did, for the whole hill-back was one billowy, white
ocean; the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises
and depressions in the ground: many pits, at least, were filled
to a level; and entire ranges of mounds, the refuse of the
quarries, blotted from the chart which my yesterday&rsquo;s walk
left pictured in my mind.&nbsp; I had remarked on one side of the
road, at intervals of six or seven yards, a line of upright
stones, continued through the whole length of the barren: these
were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides
in the dark, and also when a fall, like the present, confounded
the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path: but,
excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there, all traces of
their existence had vanished: and my companion found it necessary
to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left, when I
imagined I was following, correctly, the windings of the
road.</p>
<p>We exchanged little conversation, and he halted at the
entrance of Thrushcross Park, saying, I could make no error
there.&nbsp; Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow, and then I
pushed forward, trusting to my own resources; for the
porter&rsquo;s lodge is untenanted as yet.&nbsp; The distance
from the gate to the grange is two miles; I believe I managed to
make it four, what with losing myself among the trees, and
sinking up to the neck in snow: a predicament which only those
who have experienced it can appreciate.&nbsp; At any rate,
whatever were my wanderings, the clock chimed twelve as I entered
the house; and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the
usual way from Wuthering Heights.</p>
<p>My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me;
exclaiming, tumultuously, they had completely given me up:
everybody conjectured that I perished last night; and they were
wondering how they must set about the search for my
remains.&nbsp; I bid them be quiet, now that they saw me
returned, and, benumbed to my very heart, I dragged up-stairs;
whence, after putting on dry clothes, and pacing to and fro
thirty or forty minutes, to restore the animal heat, I adjourned
to my study, feeble as a kitten: almost too much so to enjoy the
cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant had prepared
for my refreshment.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>What vain weathercocks we are!&nbsp; I, who had determined to
hold myself independent of all social intercourse, and thanked my
stars that, at length, I had lighted on a spot where it was next
to impracticable&mdash;I, weak wretch, after maintaining till
dusk a struggle with low spirits and solitude, was finally
compelled to strike my colours; and under pretence of gaining
information concerning the necessities of my establishment, I
desired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in supper, to sit down while
I ate it; hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip, and
either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have lived here a considerable time,&rsquo; I
commenced; &lsquo;did you not say sixteen years?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eighteen, sir: I came when the mistress was married, to
wait on her; after she died, the master retained me for his
housekeeper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There ensued a pause.&nbsp; She was not a gossip, I feared;
unless about her own affairs, and those could hardly interest
me.&nbsp; However, having studied for an interval, with a fist on
either knee, and a cloud of meditation over her ruddy
countenance, she ejaculated&mdash;&lsquo;Ah, times are greatly
changed since then!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I remarked, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve seen a good
many alterations, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have: and troubles too,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll turn the talk on my landlord&rsquo;s
family!&rsquo; I thought to myself.&nbsp; &lsquo;A good subject
to start!&nbsp; And that pretty girl-widow, I should like to know
her history: whether she be a native of the country, or, as is
more probable, an exotic that the surly <i>indigenae</i> will not
recognise for kin.&rsquo;&nbsp; With this intention I asked Mrs.
Dean why Heathcliff let Thrushcross Grange, and preferred living
in a situation and residence so much inferior.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is he
not rich enough to keep the estate in good order?&rsquo; I
inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rich, sir!&rsquo; she returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has
nobody knows what money, and every year it increases.&nbsp; Yes,
yes, he&rsquo;s rich enough to live in a finer house than this:
but he&rsquo;s very near&mdash;close-handed; and, if he had meant
to flit to Thrushcross Grange, as soon as he heard of a good
tenant he could not have borne to miss the chance of getting a
few hundreds more.&nbsp; It is strange people should be so
greedy, when they are alone in the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He had a son, it seems?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he had one&mdash;he is dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that young lady, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his
widow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where did she come from originally?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, sir, she is my late master&rsquo;s daughter:
Catherine Linton was her maiden name.&nbsp; I nursed her, poor
thing!&nbsp; I did wish Mr. Heathcliff would remove here, and
then we might have been together again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&nbsp; Catherine Linton?&rsquo; I exclaimed,
astonished.&nbsp; But a minute&rsquo;s reflection convinced me it
was not my ghostly Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; I continued,
&lsquo;my predecessor&rsquo;s name was Linton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who is that Earnshaw: Hareton Earnshaw, who lives
with Mr. Heathcliff?&nbsp; Are they relations?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; he is the late Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s
nephew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The young lady&rsquo;s cousin, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and her husband was her cousin also: one on the
mother&rsquo;s, the other on the father&rsquo;s side: Heathcliff
married Mr. Linton&rsquo;s sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see the house at Wuthering Heights has
&ldquo;Earnshaw&rdquo; carved over the front door.&nbsp; Are they
an old family?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our
Miss Cathy is of us&mdash;I mean, of the Lintons.&nbsp; Have you
been to Wuthering Heights?&nbsp; I beg pardon for asking; but I
should like to hear how she is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Heathcliff? she looked very well, and very
handsome; yet, I think, not very happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dear, I don&rsquo;t wonder!&nbsp; And how did you
like the master?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A rough fellow, rather, Mrs. Dean.&nbsp; Is not that
his character?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone!&nbsp; The
less you meddle with him the better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him
such a churl.&nbsp; Do you know anything of his
history?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a cuckoo&rsquo;s, sir&mdash;I know all about
it: except where he was born, and who were his parents, and how
he got his money at first.&nbsp; And Hareton has been cast out
like an unfledged dunnock!&nbsp; The unfortunate lad is the only
one in all this parish that does not guess how he has been
cheated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell
me something of my neighbours: I feel I shall not rest if I go to
bed; so be good enough to sit and chat an hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, certainly, sir!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll just fetch a
little sewing, and then I&rsquo;ll sit as long as you
please.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ve caught cold: I saw you shivering,
and you must have some gruel to drive it out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire;
my head felt hot, and the rest of me chill: moreover, I was
excited, almost to a pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and
brain.&nbsp; This caused me to feel, not uncomfortable, but
rather fearful (as I am still) of serious effects from the
incidents of to-day and yesterday.&nbsp; She returned presently,
bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work; and, having placed
the former on the hob, drew in her seat, evidently pleased to
find me so companionable.</p>
<p>Before I came to live here, she commenced&mdash;waiting no
farther invitation to her story&mdash;I was almost always at
Wuthering Heights; because my mother had nursed Mr. Hindley
Earnshaw, that was Hareton&rsquo;s father, and I got used to
playing with the children: I ran errands too, and helped to make
hay, and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody
would set me to.&nbsp; One fine summer morning&mdash;it was the
beginning of harvest, I remember&mdash;Mr. Earnshaw, the old
master, came down-stairs, dressed for a journey; and, after he
had told Joseph what was to be done during the day, he turned to
Hindley, and Cathy, and me&mdash;for I sat eating my porridge
with them&mdash;and he said, speaking to his son, &lsquo;Now, my
bonny man, I&rsquo;m going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I
bring you?&nbsp; You may choose what you like: only let it be
little, for I shall walk there and back: sixty miles each way,
that is a long spell!&rsquo;&nbsp; Hindley named a fiddle, and
then he asked Miss Cathy; she was hardly six years old, but she
could ride any horse in the stable, and she chose a whip.&nbsp;
He did not forget me; for he had a kind heart, though he was
rather severe sometimes.&nbsp; He promised to bring me a
pocketful of apples and pears, and then he kissed his children,
said good-bye, and set off.</p>
<p>It seemed a long while to us all&mdash;the three days of his
absence&mdash;and often did little Cathy ask when he would be
home.&nbsp; Mrs. Earnshaw expected him by supper-time on the
third evening, and she put the meal off hour after hour; there
were no signs of his coming, however, and at last the children
got tired of running down to the gate to look.&nbsp; Then it grew
dark; she would have had them to bed, but they begged sadly to be
allowed to stay up; and, just about eleven o&rsquo;clock, the
door-latch was raised quietly, and in stepped the master.&nbsp;
He threw himself into a chair, laughing and groaning, and bid
them all stand off, for he was nearly killed&mdash;he would not
have such another walk for the three kingdoms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And at the end of it to be flighted to death!&rsquo; he
said, opening his great-coat, which he held bundled up in his
arms.&nbsp; &lsquo;See here, wife!&nbsp; I was never so beaten
with anything in my life: but you must e&rsquo;en take it as a
gift of God; though it&rsquo;s as dark almost as if it came from
the devil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy&rsquo;s head I had a
peep at a dirty, ragged, black-haired child; big enough both to
walk and talk: indeed, its face looked older than
Catherine&rsquo;s; yet when it was set on its feet, it only
stared round, and repeated over and over again some gibberish
that nobody could understand.&nbsp; I was frightened, and Mrs.
Earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors: she did fly up,
asking how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the
house, when they had their own bairns to feed and fend for?&nbsp;
What he meant to do with it, and whether he were mad?&nbsp; The
master tried to explain the matter; but he was really half dead
with fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst her
scolding, was a tale of his seeing it starving, and houseless,
and as good as dumb, in the streets of Liverpool, where he picked
it up and inquired for its owner.&nbsp; Not a soul knew to whom
it belonged, he said; and his money and time being both limited,
he thought it better to take it home with him at once, than run
into vain expenses there: because he was determined he would not
leave it as he found it.&nbsp; Well, the conclusion was, that my
mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr. Earnshaw told me to wash
it, and give it clean things, and let it sleep with the
children.</p>
<p>Hindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and
listening till peace was restored: then, both began searching
their father&rsquo;s pockets for the presents he had promised
them.&nbsp; The former was a boy of fourteen, but when he drew
out what had been a fiddle, crushed to morsels in the great-coat,
he blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she learned the master had
lost her whip in attending on the stranger, showed her humour by
grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing; earning for her
pains a sound blow from her father, to teach her cleaner
manners.&nbsp; They entirely refused to have it in bed with them,
or even in their room; and I had no more sense, so I put it on
the landing of the stairs, hoping it might be gone on the
morrow.&nbsp; By chance, or else attracted by hearing his voice,
it crept to Mr. Earnshaw&rsquo;s door, and there he found it on
quitting his chamber.&nbsp; Inquiries were made as to how it got
there; I was obliged to confess, and in recompense for my
cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house.</p>
<p>This was Heathcliff&rsquo;s first introduction to the
family.&nbsp; On coming back a few days afterwards (for I did not
consider my banishment perpetual), I found they had christened
him &lsquo;Heathcliff&rsquo;: it was the name of a son who died
in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for
Christian and surname.&nbsp; Miss Cathy and he were now very
thick; but Hindley hated him: and to say the truth I did the
same; and we plagued and went on with him shamefully: for I
wasn&rsquo;t reasonable enough to feel my injustice, and the
mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him
wronged.</p>
<p>He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to
ill-treatment: he would stand Hindley&rsquo;s blows without
winking or shedding a tear, and my pinches moved him only to draw
in a breath and open his eyes, as if he had hurt himself by
accident, and nobody was to blame.&nbsp; This endurance made old
Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son persecuting the poor
fatherless child, as he called him.&nbsp; He took to Heathcliff
strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said
precious little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far
above Cathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a
favourite.</p>
<p>So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house;
and at Mrs. Earnshaw&rsquo;s death, which happened in less than
two years after, the young master had learned to regard his
father as an oppressor rather than a friend, and Heathcliff as a
usurper of his parent&rsquo;s affections and his privileges; and
he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries.&nbsp; I
sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the
measles, and I had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a
woman at once, I changed my idea.&nbsp; Heathcliff was
dangerously sick; and while he lay at the worst he would have me
constantly by his pillow: I suppose he felt I did a good deal for
him, and he hadn&rsquo;t wit to guess that I was compelled to do
it.&nbsp; However, I will say this, he was the quietest child
that ever nurse watched over.&nbsp; The difference between him
and the others forced me to be less partial.&nbsp; Cathy and her
brother harassed me terribly: he was as uncomplaining as a lamb;
though hardness, not gentleness, made him give little
trouble.</p>
<p>He got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great
measure owing to me, and praised me for my care.&nbsp; I was vain
of his commendations, and softened towards the being by whose
means I earned them, and thus Hindley lost his last ally: still I
couldn&rsquo;t dote on Heathcliff, and I wondered often what my
master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy; who never, to my
recollection, repaid his indulgence by any sign of
gratitude.&nbsp; He was not insolent to his benefactor, he was
simply insensible; though knowing perfectly the hold he had on
his heart, and conscious he had only to speak and all the house
would be obliged to bend to his wishes.&nbsp; As an instance, I
remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the parish
fair, and gave the lads each one.&nbsp; Heathcliff took the
handsomest, but it soon fell lame, and when he discovered it, he
said to Hindley&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must exchange horses with me: I don&rsquo;t like
mine; and if you won&rsquo;t I shall tell your father of the
three thrashings you&rsquo;ve given me this week, and show him my
arm, which is black to the shoulder.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hindley put out
his tongue, and cuffed him over the ears.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better do it at once,&rsquo; he persisted,
escaping to the porch (they were in the stable): &lsquo;you will
have to: and if I speak of these blows, you&rsquo;ll get them
again with interest.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Off, dog!&rsquo; cried
Hindley, threatening him with an iron weight used for weighing
potatoes and hay.&nbsp; &lsquo;Throw it,&rsquo; he replied,
standing still, &lsquo;and then I&rsquo;ll tell how you boasted
that you would turn me out of doors as soon as he died, and see
whether he will not turn you out directly.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hindley
threw it, hitting him on the breast, and down he fell, but
staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and, had not I
prevented it, he would have gone just so to the master, and got
full revenge by letting his condition plead for him, intimating
who had caused it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take my colt, Gipsy, then!&rsquo;
said young Earnshaw.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I pray that he may break
your neck: take him, and be damned, you beggarly interloper! and
wheedle my father out of all he has: only afterwards show him
what you are, imp of Satan.&mdash;And take that, I hope
he&rsquo;ll kick out your brains!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his
own stall; he was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his
speech by knocking him under its feet, and without stopping to
examine whether his hopes were fulfilled, ran away as fast as he
could.&nbsp; I was surprised to witness how coolly the child
gathered himself up, and went on with his intention; exchanging
saddles and all, and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to
overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned, before he
entered the house.&nbsp; I persuaded him easily to let me lay the
blame of his bruises on the horse: he minded little what tale was
told since he had what he wanted.&nbsp; He complained so seldom,
indeed, of such stirs as these, that I really thought him not
vindictive: I was deceived completely, as you will hear.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>In the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail.&nbsp; He had
been active and healthy, yet his strength left him suddenly; and
when he was confined to the chimney-corner he grew grievously
irritable.&nbsp; A nothing vexed him; and suspected slights of
his authority nearly threw him into fits.&nbsp; This was
especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon, or
domineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a
word should be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his
head the notion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and
longed to do him an ill-turn.&nbsp; It was a disadvantage to the
lad; for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master, so
we humoured his partiality; and that humouring was rich
nourishment to the child&rsquo;s pride and black tempers.&nbsp;
Still it became in a manner necessary; twice, or thrice,
Hindley&rsquo;s manifestation of scorn, while his father was
near, roused the old man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike
him, and shook with rage that he could not do it.</p>
<p>At last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living
answer by teaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming
his bit of land himself) advised that the young man should be
sent to college; and Mr. Earnshaw agreed, though with a heavy
spirit, for he said&mdash;&lsquo;Hindley was nought, and would
never thrive as where he wandered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I hoped heartily we should have peace now.&nbsp; It hurt me to
think the master should be made uncomfortable by his own good
deed.&nbsp; I fancied the discontent of age and disease arose
from his family disagreements; as he would have it that it did:
really, you know, sir, it was in his sinking frame.&nbsp; We
might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for two
people&mdash;Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him, I
daresay, up yonder.&nbsp; He was, and is yet most likely, the
wearisomest self-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible
to rake the promises to himself and fling the curses to his
neighbours.&nbsp; By his knack of sermonising and pious
discoursing, he contrived to make a great impression on Mr.
Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master became, the more
influence he gained.&nbsp; He was relentless in worrying him
about his soul&rsquo;s concerns, and about ruling his children
rigidly.&nbsp; He encouraged him to regard Hindley as a
reprobate; and, night after night, he regularly grumbled out a
long string of tales against Heathcliff and Catherine: always
minding to flatter Earnshaw&rsquo;s weakness by heaping the
heaviest blame on the latter.</p>
<p>Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child
take up before; and she put all of us past our patience fifty
times and oftener in a day: from the hour she came down-stairs
till the hour she went to bed, we had not a minute&rsquo;s
security that she wouldn&rsquo;t be in mischief.&nbsp; Her
spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always
going&mdash;singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody who would
not do the same.&nbsp; A wild, wicked slip she was&mdash;but she
had the bonniest eye, the sweetest smile, and lightest foot in
the parish: and, after all, I believe she meant no harm; for when
once she made you cry in good earnest, it seldom happened that
she would not keep you company, and oblige you to be quiet that
you might comfort her.&nbsp; She was much too fond of
Heathcliff.&nbsp; The greatest punishment we could invent for her
was to keep her separate from him: yet she got chided more than
any of us on his account.&nbsp; In play, she liked exceedingly to
act the little mistress; using her hands freely, and commanding
her companions: she did so to me, but I would not bear slapping
and ordering; and so I let her know.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children:
he had always been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on
her part, had no idea why her father should be crosser and less
patient in his ailing condition than he was in his prime.&nbsp;
His peevish reproofs wakened in her a naughty delight to provoke
him: she was never so happy as when we were all scolding her at
once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy look, and her ready
words; turning Joseph&rsquo;s religious curses into ridicule,
baiting me, and doing just what her father hated
most&mdash;showing how her pretended insolence, which he thought
real, had more power over Heathcliff than his kindness: how the
boy would do <i>her</i> bidding in anything, and <i>his</i> only
when it suited his own inclination.&nbsp; After behaving as badly
as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to make it up at
night.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay, Cathy,&rsquo; the old man would say,
&lsquo;I cannot love thee, thou&rsquo;rt worse than thy
brother.&nbsp; Go, say thy prayers, child, and ask God&rsquo;s
pardon.&nbsp; I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever
reared thee!&rsquo;&nbsp; That made her cry, at first; and then
being repulsed continually hardened her, and she laughed if I
told her to say she was sorry for her faults, and beg to be
forgiven.</p>
<p>But the hour came, at last, that ended Mr. Earnshaw&rsquo;s
troubles on earth.&nbsp; He died quietly in his chair one October
evening, seated by the fire-side.&nbsp; A high wind blustered
round the house, and roared in the chimney: it sounded wild and
stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were all together&mdash;I, a
little removed from the hearth, busy at my knitting, and Joseph
reading his Bible near the table (for the servants generally sat
in the house then, after their work was done).&nbsp; Miss Cathy
had been sick, and that made her still; she leant against her
father&rsquo;s knee, and Heathcliff was lying on the floor with
his head in her lap.&nbsp; I remember the master, before he fell
into a doze, stroking her bonny hair&mdash;it pleased him rarely
to see her gentle&mdash;and saying, &lsquo;Why canst thou not
always be a good lass, Cathy?&rsquo;&nbsp; And she turned her
face up to his, and laughed, and answered, &lsquo;Why cannot you
always be a good man, father?&rsquo;&nbsp; But as soon as she saw
him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and said she would sing him
to sleep.&nbsp; She began singing very low, till his fingers
dropped from hers, and his head sank on his breast.&nbsp; Then I
told her to hush, and not stir, for fear she should wake
him.&nbsp; We all kept as mute as mice a full half-hour, and
should have done so longer, only Joseph, having finished his
chapter, got up and said that he must rouse the master for
prayers and bed.&nbsp; He stepped forward, and called him by
name, and touched his shoulder; but he would not move: so he took
the candle and looked at him.&nbsp; I thought there was something
wrong as he set down the light; and seizing the children each by
an arm, whispered them to &lsquo;frame up-stairs, and make little
din&mdash;they might pray alone that evening&mdash;he had summut
to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall bid father good-night first,&rsquo; said
Catherine, putting her arms round his neck, before we could
hinder her.&nbsp; The poor thing discovered her loss
directly&mdash;she screamed out&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s dead,
Heathcliff! he&rsquo;s dead!&rsquo;&nbsp; And they both set up a
heart-breaking cry.</p>
<p>I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked
what we could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in
heaven.&nbsp; He told me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton
for the doctor and the parson.&nbsp; I could not guess the use
that either would be of, then.&nbsp; However, I went, through
wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor, back with me; the
other said he would come in the morning.&nbsp; Leaving Joseph to
explain matters, I ran to the children&rsquo;s room: their door
was ajar, I saw they had never lain down, though it was past
midnight; but they were calmer, and did not need me to console
them.&nbsp; The little souls were comforting each other with
better thoughts than I could have hit on: no parson in the world
ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did, in their
innocent talk; and, while I sobbed and listened, I could not help
wishing we were all there safe together.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>Mr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and&mdash;a thing that
amazed us, and set the neighbours gossiping right and
left&mdash;he brought a wife with him.&nbsp; What she was, and
where she was born, he never informed us: probably, she had
neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely
have kept the union from his father.</p>
<p>She was not one that would have disturbed the house much on
her own account.&nbsp; Every object she saw, the moment she
crossed the threshold, appeared to delight her; and every
circumstance that took place about her: except the preparing for
the burial, and the presence of the mourners.&nbsp; I thought she
was half silly, from her behaviour while that went on: she ran
into her chamber, and made me come with her, though I should have
been dressing the children: and there she sat shivering and
clasping her hands, and asking repeatedly&mdash;&lsquo;Are they
gone yet?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she began describing with hysterical
emotion the effect it produced on her to see black; and started,
and trembled, and, at last, fell a-weeping&mdash;and when I asked
what was the matter, answered, she didn&rsquo;t know; but she
felt so afraid of dying!&nbsp; I imagined her as little likely to
die as myself.&nbsp; She was rather thin, but young, and
fresh-complexioned, and her eyes sparkled as bright as
diamonds.&nbsp; I did remark, to be sure, that mounting the
stairs made her breathe very quick; that the least sudden noise
set her all in a quiver, and that she coughed troublesomely
sometimes: but I knew nothing of what these symptoms portended,
and had no impulse to sympathise with her.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t
in general take to foreigners here, Mr. Lockwood, unless they
take to us first.</p>
<p>Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of
his absence.&nbsp; He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and
spoke and dressed quite differently; and, on the very day of his
return, he told Joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter
ourselves in the back-kitchen, and leave the house for him.&nbsp;
Indeed, he would have carpeted and papered a small spare room for
a parlour; but his wife expressed such pleasure at the white
floor and huge glowing fireplace, at the pewter dishes and
delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space there was to move
about in where they usually sat, that he thought it unnecessary
to her comfort, and so dropped the intention.</p>
<p>She expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new
acquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and
ran about with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the
beginning.&nbsp; Her affection tired very soon, however, and when
she grew peevish, Hindley became tyrannical.&nbsp; A few words
from her, evincing a dislike to Heathcliff, were enough to rouse
in him all his old hatred of the boy.&nbsp; He drove him from
their company to the servants, deprived him of the instructions
of the curate, and insisted that he should labour out of doors
instead; compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the
farm.</p>
<p>Heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because
Cathy taught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him
in the fields.&nbsp; They both promised fair to grow up as rude
as savages; the young master being entirely negligent how they
behaved, and what they did, so they kept clear of him.&nbsp; He
would not even have seen after their going to church on Sundays,
only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his carelessness when they
absented themselves; and that reminded him to order Heathcliff a
flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or supper.&nbsp; But
it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in
the morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment
grew a mere thing to laugh at.&nbsp; The curate might set as many
chapters as he pleased for Catherine to get by heart, and Joseph
might thrash Heathcliff till his arm ached; they forgot
everything the minute they were together again: at least the
minute they had contrived some naughty plan of revenge; and many
a time I&rsquo;ve cried to myself to watch them growing more
reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable, for fear of
losing the small power I still retained over the unfriended
creatures.&nbsp; One Sunday evening, it chanced that they were
banished from the sitting-room, for making a noise, or a light
offence of the kind; and when I went to call them to supper, I
could discover them nowhere.&nbsp; We searched the house, above
and below, and the yard and stables; they were invisible: and, at
last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors, and swore
nobody should let them in that night.&nbsp; The household went to
bed; and I, too, anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put
my head out to hearken, though it rained: determined to admit
them in spite of the prohibition, should they return.&nbsp; In a
while, I distinguished steps coming up the road, and the light of
a lantern glimmered through the gate.&nbsp; I threw a shawl over
my head and ran to prevent them from waking Mr. Earnshaw by
knocking.&nbsp; There was Heathcliff, by himself: it gave me a
start to see him alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is Miss Catherine?&rsquo; I cried
hurriedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;No accident, I hope?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;At Thrushcross Grange,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;and I
would have been there too, but they had not the manners to ask me
to stay.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, you will catch it!&rsquo; I
said: &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll never be content till you&rsquo;re sent
about your business.&nbsp; What in the world led you wandering to
Thrushcross Grange?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me get off my wet
clothes, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it, Nelly,&rsquo; he
replied.&nbsp; I bid him beware of rousing the master, and while
he undressed and I waited to put out the candle, he
continued&mdash;&lsquo;Cathy and I escaped from the wash-house to
have a ramble at liberty, and getting a glimpse of the Grange
lights, we thought we would just go and see whether the Lintons
passed their Sunday evenings standing shivering in corners, while
their father and mother sat eating and drinking, and singing and
laughing, and burning their eyes out before the fire.&nbsp; Do
you think they do?&nbsp; Or reading sermons, and being catechised
by their manservant, and set to learn a column of Scripture
names, if they don&rsquo;t answer properly?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Probably not,&rsquo; I responded.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are
good children, no doubt, and don&rsquo;t deserve the treatment
you receive, for your bad conduct.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cant, Nelly,&rsquo; he said:
&lsquo;nonsense!&nbsp; We ran from the top of the Heights to the
park, without stopping&mdash;Catherine completely beaten in the
race, because she was barefoot.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to seek
for her shoes in the bog to-morrow.&nbsp; We crept through a
broken hedge, groped our way up the path, and planted ourselves
on a flower-plot under the drawing-room window.&nbsp; The light
came from thence; they had not put up the shutters, and the
curtains were only half closed.&nbsp; Both of us were able to
look in by standing on the basement, and clinging to the ledge,
and we saw&mdash;ah! it was beautiful&mdash;a splendid place
carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and tables, and
a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of glass-drops
hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering with
little soft tapers.&nbsp; Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there;
Edgar and his sisters had it entirely to themselves.&nbsp;
Shouldn&rsquo;t they have been happy?&nbsp; We should have
thought ourselves in heaven!&nbsp; And now, guess what your good
children were doing?&nbsp; Isabella&mdash;I believe she is
eleven, a year younger than Cathy&mdash;lay screaming at the
farther end of the room, shrieking as if witches were running
red-hot needles into her.&nbsp; Edgar stood on the hearth weeping
silently, and in the middle of the table sat a little dog,
shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual
accusations, we understood they had nearly pulled in two between
them.&nbsp; The idiots!&nbsp; That was their pleasure! to quarrel
who should hold a heap of warm hair, and each begin to cry
because both, after struggling to get it, refused to take
it.&nbsp; We laughed outright at the petted things; we did
despise them!&nbsp; When would you catch me wishing to have what
Catherine wanted? or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment
in yelling, and sobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by
the whole room?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d not exchange, for a thousand
lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton&rsquo;s at Thrushcross
Grange&mdash;not if I might have the privilege of flinging Joseph
off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with
Hindley&rsquo;s blood!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, hush!&rsquo; I interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Still
you have not told me, Heathcliff, how Catherine is left
behind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you we laughed,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The Lintons heard us, and with one accord they shot like
arrows to the door; there was silence, and then a cry, &ldquo;Oh,
mamma, mamma!&nbsp; Oh, papa!&nbsp; Oh, mamma, come here.&nbsp;
Oh, papa, oh!&rdquo;&nbsp; They really did howl out something in
that way.&nbsp; We made frightful noises to terrify them still
more, and then we dropped off the ledge, because somebody was
drawing the bars, and we felt we had better flee.&nbsp; I had
Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all at once she
fell down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Run, Heathcliff, run!&rdquo; she
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have let the bull-dog loose, and he
holds me!&rdquo;&nbsp; The devil had seized her ankle, Nelly: I
heard his abominable snorting.&nbsp; She did not yell
out&mdash;no! she would have scorned to do it, if she had been
spitted on the horns of a mad cow.&nbsp; I did, though: I
vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in Christendom;
and I got a stone and thrust it between his jaws, and tried with
all my might to cram it down his throat.&nbsp; A beast of a
servant came up with a lantern, at last,
shouting&mdash;&ldquo;Keep fast, Skulker, keep fast!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He changed his note, however, when he saw Skulker&rsquo;s
game.&nbsp; The dog was throttled off; his huge, purple tongue
hanging half a foot out of his mouth, and his pendent lips
streaming with bloody slaver.&nbsp; The man took Cathy up; she
was sick: not from fear, I&rsquo;m certain, but from pain.&nbsp;
He carried her in; I followed, grumbling execrations and
vengeance.&nbsp; &ldquo;What prey, Robert?&rdquo; hallooed Linton
from the entrance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Skulker has caught a little girl,
sir,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s a lad
here,&rdquo; he added, making a clutch at me, &ldquo;who looks an
out-and-outer!&nbsp; Very like the robbers were for putting them
through the window to open the doors to the gang after all were
asleep, that they might murder us at their ease.&nbsp; Hold your
tongue, you foul-mouthed thief, you! you shall go to the gallows
for this.&nbsp; Mr. Linton, sir, don&rsquo;t lay by your
gun.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, Robert,&rdquo; said the old
fool.&nbsp; &ldquo;The rascals knew that yesterday was my
rent-day: they thought to have me cleverly.&nbsp; Come in;
I&rsquo;ll furnish them a reception.&nbsp; There, John, fasten
the chain.&nbsp; Give Skulker some water, Jenny.&nbsp; To beard a
magistrate in his stronghold, and on the Sabbath, too!&nbsp;
Where will their insolence stop?&nbsp; Oh, my dear Mary, look
here!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be afraid, it is but a boy&mdash;yet the
villain scowls so plainly in his face; would it not be a kindness
to the country to hang him at once, before he shows his nature in
acts as well as features?&rdquo;&nbsp; He pulled me under the
chandelier, and Mrs. Linton placed her spectacles on her nose and
raised her hands in horror.&nbsp; The cowardly children crept
nearer also, Isabella lisping&mdash;&ldquo;Frightful thing!&nbsp;
Put him in the cellar, papa.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s exactly like the
son of the fortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant.&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t he, Edgar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the
last speech, and laughed.&nbsp; Edgar Linton, after an
inquisitive stare, collected sufficient wit to recognise
her.&nbsp; They see us at church, you know, though we seldom meet
them elsewhere.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Miss Earnshaw?&rdquo;
he whispered to his mother, &ldquo;and look how Skulker has
bitten her&mdash;how her foot bleeds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Miss Earnshaw?&nbsp; Nonsense!&rdquo; cried the
dame; &ldquo;Miss Earnshaw scouring the country with a
gipsy!&nbsp; And yet, my dear, the child is in
mourning&mdash;surely it is&mdash;and she may be lamed for
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What culpable carelessness in her
brother!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Linton, turning from me to
Catherine.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve understood from
Shielders&rdquo;&rsquo; (that was the curate, sir)
&lsquo;&ldquo;that he lets her grow up in absolute
heathenism.&nbsp; But who is this?&nbsp; Where did she pick up
this companion?&nbsp; Oho! I declare he is that strange
acquisition my late neighbour made, in his journey to
Liverpool&mdash;a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish
castaway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;A wicked boy, at all events,&rdquo; remarked the
old lady, &ldquo;and quite unfit for a decent house!&nbsp; Did
you notice his language, Linton?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m shocked that my
children should have heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I recommenced cursing&mdash;don&rsquo;t be angry,
Nelly&mdash;and so Robert was ordered to take me off.&nbsp; I
refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me into the garden,
pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw
should be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march
directly, secured the door again.&nbsp; The curtains were still
looped up at one corner, and I resumed my station as spy;
because, if Catherine had wished to return, I intended shattering
their great glass panes to a million of fragments, unless they
let her out.&nbsp; She sat on the sofa quietly.&nbsp; Mrs. Linton
took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we had borrowed
for our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with her, I
suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction
between her treatment and mine.&nbsp; Then the woman-servant
brought a basin of warm water, and washed her feet; and Mr.
Linton mixed a tumbler of negus, and Isabella emptied a plateful
of cakes into her lap, and Edgar stood gaping at a
distance.&nbsp; Afterwards, they dried and combed her beautiful
hair, and gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled her
to the fire; and I left her, as merry as she could be, dividing
her food between the little dog and Skulker, whose nose she
pinched as he ate; and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant
blue eyes of the Lintons&mdash;a dim reflection from her own
enchanting face.&nbsp; I saw they were full of stupid admiration;
she is so immeasurably superior to them&mdash;to everybody on
earth, is she not, Nelly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There will more come of this business than you reckon
on,&rsquo; I answered, covering him up and extinguishing the
light.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are incurable, Heathcliff; and Mr.
Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if he
won&rsquo;t.&rsquo;&nbsp; My words came truer than I
desired.&nbsp; The luckless adventure made Earnshaw
furious.&nbsp; And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a
visit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a
lecture on the road he guided his family, that he was stirred to
look about him, in earnest.&nbsp; Heathcliff received no
flogging, but he was told that the first word he spoke to Miss
Catherine should ensure a dismissal; and Mrs. Earnshaw undertook
to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint when she returned
home; employing art, not force: with force she would have found
it impossible.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till
Christmas.&nbsp; By that time her ankle was thoroughly cured, and
her manners much improved.&nbsp; The mistress visited her often
in the interval, and commenced her plan of reform by trying to
raise her self-respect with fine clothes and flattery, which she
took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless little savage
jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all breathless,
there &lsquo;lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified
person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered
beaver, and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up
with both hands that she might sail in.&nbsp; Hindley lifted her
from her horse, exclaiming delightedly, &lsquo;Why, Cathy, you
are quite a beauty!&nbsp; I should scarcely have known you: you
look like a lady now.&nbsp; Isabella Linton is not to be compared
with her, is she, Frances?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Isabella has not
her natural advantages,&rsquo; replied his wife: &lsquo;but she
must mind and not grow wild again here.&nbsp; Ellen, help Miss
Catherine off with her things&mdash;Stay, dear, you will
disarrange your curls&mdash;let me untie your hat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand
plaid silk frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while
her eyes sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to
welcome her, she dared hardly touch them lest they should fawn
upon her splendid garments.&nbsp; She kissed me gently: I was all
flour making the Christmas cake, and it would not have done to
give me a hug; and then she looked round for Heathcliff.&nbsp;
Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting; thinking
it would enable them to judge, in some measure, what grounds they
had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends.</p>
<p>Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first.&nbsp; If he were
careless, and uncared for, before Catherine&rsquo;s absence, he
had been ten times more so since.&nbsp; Nobody but I even did him
the kindness to call him a dirty boy, and bid him wash himself,
once a week; and children of his age seldom have a natural
pleasure in soap and water.&nbsp; Therefore, not to mention his
clothes, which had seen three months&rsquo; service in mire and
dust, and his thick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and
hands was dismally beclouded.&nbsp; He might well skulk behind
the settle, on beholding such a bright, graceful damsel enter the
house, instead of a rough-headed counterpart of himself, as he
expected.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is Heathcliff not here?&rsquo; she
demanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers
wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heathcliff, you may come forward,&rsquo; cried Mr.
Hindley, enjoying his discomfiture, and gratified to see what a
forbidding young blackguard he would be compelled to present
himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;You may come and wish Miss Catherine
welcome, like the other servants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment,
flew to embrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his
cheek within the second, and then stopped, and drawing back,
burst into a laugh, exclaiming, &lsquo;Why, how very black and
cross you look! and how&mdash;how funny and grim!&nbsp; But
that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m used to Edgar and Isabella
Linton.&nbsp; Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride
threw double gloom over his countenance, and kept him
immovable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shake hands, Heathcliff,&rsquo; said Mr. Earnshaw,
condescendingly; &lsquo;once in a way that is
permitted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not,&rsquo; replied the boy, finding his tongue
at last; &lsquo;I shall not stand to be laughed at.&nbsp; I shall
not bear it!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he would have broken from the
circle, but Miss Cathy seized him again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not mean to laugh at you,&rsquo; she said;
&lsquo;I could not hinder myself: Heathcliff, shake hands at
least!&nbsp; What are you sulky for?&nbsp; It was only that you
looked odd.&nbsp; If you wash your face and brush your hair, it
will be all right: but you are so dirty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her
own, and also at her dress; which she feared had gained no
embellishment from its contact with his.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t have touched me!&rsquo; he answered,
following her eye and snatching away his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
shall be as dirty as I please: and I like to be dirty, and I will
be dirty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the
merriment of the master and mistress, and to the serious
disturbance of Catherine; who could not comprehend how her
remarks should have produced such an exhibition of bad
temper.</p>
<p>After playing lady&rsquo;s-maid to the new-comer, and putting
my cakes in the oven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful
with great fires, befitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down
and amuse myself by singing carols, all alone; regardless of
Joseph&rsquo;s affirmations that he considered the merry tunes I
chose as next door to songs.&nbsp; He had retired to private
prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw were engaging
Missy&rsquo;s attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to
present to the little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their
kindness.&nbsp; They had invited them to spend the morrow at
Wuthering Heights, and the invitation had been accepted, on one
condition: Mrs. Linton begged that her darlings might be kept
carefully apart from that &lsquo;naughty swearing boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Under these circumstances I remained solitary.&nbsp; I smelt
the rich scent of the heating spices; and admired the shining
kitchen utensils, the polished clock, decked in holly, the silver
mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for
supper; and above all, the speckless purity of my particular
care&mdash;the scoured and well-swept floor.&nbsp; I gave due
inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old
Earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant
lass, and slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and
from that I went on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and
his dread lest he should suffer neglect after death had removed
him: and that naturally led me to consider the poor lad&rsquo;s
situation now, and from singing I changed my mind to
crying.&nbsp; It struck me soon, however, there would be more
sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding
tears over them: I got up and walked into the court to seek
him.&nbsp; He was not far; I found him smoothing the glossy coat
of the new pony in the stable, and feeding the other beasts,
according to custom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Make haste, Heathcliff!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;the
kitchen is so comfortable; and Joseph is up-stairs: make haste,
and let me dress you smart before Miss Cathy comes out, and then
you can sit together, with the whole hearth to yourselves, and
have a long chatter till bedtime.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards
me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come&mdash;are you coming?&rsquo; I continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a little cake for each of you, nearly
enough; and you&rsquo;ll need half-an-hour&rsquo;s
donning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him.&nbsp;
Catherine supped with her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I
joined at an unsociable meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side
and sauciness on the other.&nbsp; His cake and cheese remained on
the table all night for the fairies.&nbsp; He managed to continue
work till nine o&rsquo;clock, and then marched dumb and dour to
his chamber.&nbsp; Cathy sat up late, having a world of things to
order for the reception of her new friends: she came into the
kitchen once to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she
only stayed to ask what was the matter with him, and then went
back.&nbsp; In the morning he rose early; and, as it was a
holiday, carried his ill-humour on to the moors; not re-appearing
till the family were departed for church.&nbsp; Fasting and
reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit.&nbsp;
He hung about me for a while, and having screwed up his courage,
exclaimed abruptly&mdash;&lsquo;Nelly, make me decent, I&rsquo;m
going to be good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;High time, Heathcliff,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;you
<i>have</i> grieved Catherine: she&rsquo;s sorry she ever came
home, I daresay!&nbsp; It looks as if you envied her, because she
is more thought of than you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The notion of <i>envying</i> Catherine was incomprehensible to
him, but the notion of grieving her he understood clearly
enough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did she say she was grieved?&rsquo; he inquired,
looking very serious.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She cried when I told her you were off again this
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, <i>I</i> cried last night,&rsquo; he returned,
&lsquo;and I had more reason to cry than she.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud
heart and an empty stomach,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Proud
people breed sad sorrows for themselves.&nbsp; But, if you be
ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind, when she
comes in.&nbsp; You must go up and offer to kiss her, and
say&mdash;you know best what to say; only do it heartily, and not
as if you thought her converted into a stranger by her grand
dress.&nbsp; And now, though I have dinner to get ready,
I&rsquo;ll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar Linton shall
look quite a doll beside you: and that he does.&nbsp; You are
younger, and yet, I&rsquo;ll be bound, you are taller and twice
as broad across the shoulders; you could knock him down in a
twinkling; don&rsquo;t you feel that you could?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff&rsquo;s face brightened a moment; then it was
overcast afresh, and he sighed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that
wouldn&rsquo;t make him less handsome or me more so.&nbsp; I wish
I had light hair and a fair skin, and was dressed and behaved as
well, and had a chance of being as rich as he will be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And cried for mamma at every turn,&rsquo; I added,
&lsquo;and trembled if a country lad heaved his fist against you,
and sat at home all day for a shower of rain.&nbsp; Oh,
Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit!&nbsp; Come to the
glass, and I&rsquo;ll let you see what you should wish.&nbsp; Do
you mark those two lines between your eyes; and those thick
brows, that, instead of rising arched, sink in the middle; and
that couple of black fiends, so deeply buried, who never open
their windows boldly, but lurk glinting under them, like
devil&rsquo;s spies?&nbsp; Wish and learn to smooth away the
surly wrinkles, to raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends
to confident, innocent angels, suspecting and doubting nothing,
and always seeing friends where they are not sure of foes.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t get the expression of a vicious cur that appears to
know the kicks it gets are its dessert, and yet hates all the
world, as well as the kicker, for what it suffers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton&rsquo;s
great blue eyes and even forehead,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I do&mdash;and that won&rsquo;t help me to
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my
lad,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;if you were a regular black; and
a bad one will turn the bonniest into something worse than
ugly.&nbsp; And now that we&rsquo;ve done washing, and combing,
and sulking&mdash;tell me whether you don&rsquo;t think yourself
rather handsome?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you, I do.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re fit for a prince in disguise.&nbsp; Who knows but
your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian
queen, each of them able to buy up, with one week&rsquo;s income,
Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange together?&nbsp; And you
were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England.&nbsp;
Were I in your place, I would frame high notions of my birth; and
the thoughts of what I was should give me courage and dignity to
support the oppressions of a little farmer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and
began to look quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation
was interrupted by a rumbling sound moving up the road and
entering the court.&nbsp; He ran to the window and I to the door,
just in time to behold the two Lintons descend from the family
carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the Earnshaws
dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in
winter.&nbsp; Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and
brought them into the house and set them before the fire, which
quickly put colour into their white faces.</p>
<p>I urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable
humour, and he willingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that,
as he opened the door leading from the kitchen on one side,
Hindley opened it on the other.&nbsp; They met, and the master,
irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful, or, perhaps, eager to
keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved him back with a sudden
thrust, and angrily bade Joseph &lsquo;keep the fellow out of the
room&mdash;send him into the garret till dinner is over.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll be cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the
fruit, if left alone with them a minute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, sir,&rsquo; I could not avoid answering,
&lsquo;he&rsquo;ll touch nothing, not he: and I suppose he must
have his share of the dainties as well as we.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him
downstairs till dark,&rsquo; cried Hindley.&nbsp; &lsquo;Begone,
you vagabond!&nbsp; What! you are attempting the coxcomb, are
you?&nbsp; Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks&mdash;see
if I won&rsquo;t pull them a bit longer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are long enough already,&rsquo; observed Master
Linton, peeping from the doorway; &lsquo;I wonder they
don&rsquo;t make his head ache.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like a
colt&rsquo;s mane over his eyes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but
Heathcliff&rsquo;s violent nature was not prepared to endure the
appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate, even
then, as a rival.&nbsp; He seized a tureen of hot apple sauce
(the first thing that came under his grip) and dashed it full
against the speaker&rsquo;s face and neck; who instantly
commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine hurrying
to the place.&nbsp; Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly
and conveyed him to his chamber; where, doubtless, he
administered a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion, for he
appeared red and breathless.&nbsp; I got the dishcloth, and
rather spitefully scrubbed Edgar&rsquo;s nose and mouth,
affirming it served him right for meddling.&nbsp; His sister
began weeping to go home, and Cathy stood by confounded, blushing
for all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should not have spoken to him!&rsquo; she
expostulated with Master Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was in a bad
temper, and now you&rsquo;ve spoilt your visit; and he&rsquo;ll
be flogged: I hate him to be flogged!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t eat my
dinner.&nbsp; Why did you speak to him, Edgar?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; sobbed the youth, escaping from
my hands, and finishing the remainder of the purification with
his cambric pocket-handkerchief.&nbsp; &lsquo;I promised mamma
that I wouldn&rsquo;t say one word to him, and I
didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, don&rsquo;t cry,&rsquo; replied Catherine,
contemptuously; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re not killed.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet!&nbsp; Hush,
Isabella!&nbsp; Has anybody hurt you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, there, children&mdash;to your seats!&rsquo;
cried Hindley, bustling in.&nbsp; &lsquo;That brute of a lad has
warmed me nicely.&nbsp; Next time, Master Edgar, take the law
into your own fists&mdash;it will give you an
appetite!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the
fragrant feast.&nbsp; They were hungry after their ride, and
easily consoled, since no real harm had befallen them.&nbsp; Mr.
Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls, and the mistress made them
merry with lively talk.&nbsp; I waited behind her chair, and was
pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an indifferent air,
commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;An unfeeling child,&rsquo; I thought to myself; &lsquo;how
lightly she dismisses her old playmate&rsquo;s troubles.&nbsp; I
could not have imagined her to be so selfish.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down again: her
cheeks flushed, and the tears gushed over them.&nbsp; She slipped
her fork to the floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to
conceal her emotion.&nbsp; I did not call her unfeeling long; for
I perceived she was in purgatory throughout the day, and wearying
to find an opportunity of getting by herself, or paying a visit
to Heathcliff, who had been locked up by the master: as I
discovered, on endeavouring to introduce to him a private mess of
victuals.</p>
<p>In the evening we had a dance.&nbsp; Cathy begged that he
might be liberated then, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her
entreaties were vain, and I was appointed to supply the
deficiency.&nbsp; We got rid of all gloom in the excitement of
the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the arrival of
the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a
trombone, clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol,
besides singers.&nbsp; They go the rounds of all the respectable
houses, and receive contributions every Christmas, and we
esteemed it a first-rate treat to hear them.&nbsp; After the
usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs and glees.&nbsp;
Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty.</p>
<p>Catherine loved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at
the top of the steps, and she went up in the dark: I
followed.&nbsp; They shut the house door below, never noting our
absence, it was so full of people.&nbsp; She made no stay at the
stairs&rsquo;-head, but mounted farther, to the garret where
Heathcliff was confined, and called him.&nbsp; He stubbornly
declined answering for a while: she persevered, and finally
persuaded him to hold communion with her through the
boards.&nbsp; I let the poor things converse unmolested, till I
supposed the songs were going to cease, and the singers to get
some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to warn
her.&nbsp; Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice
within.&nbsp; The little monkey had crept by the skylight of one
garret, along the roof, into the skylight of the other, and it
was with the utmost difficulty I could coax her out again.&nbsp;
When she did come, Heathcliff came with her, and she insisted
that I should take him into the kitchen, as my fellow-servant had
gone to a neighbour&rsquo;s, to be removed from the sound of our
&lsquo;devil&rsquo;s psalmody,&rsquo; as it pleased him to call
it.&nbsp; I told them I intended by no means to encourage their
tricks: but as the prisoner had never broken his fast since
yesterday&rsquo;s dinner, I would wink at his cheating Mr.
Hindley that once.&nbsp; He went down: I set him a stool by the
fire, and offered him a quantity of good things: but he was sick
and could eat little, and my attempts to entertain him were
thrown away.&nbsp; He leant his two elbows on his knees, and his
chin on his hands and remained rapt in dumb meditation.&nbsp; On
my inquiring the subject of his thoughts, he answered
gravely&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m trying to settle how I shall pay
Hindley back.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care how long I wait, if I can
only do it at last.&nbsp; I hope he will not die before I
do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame, Heathcliff!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is for God to punish wicked people; we should learn to
forgive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, God won&rsquo;t have the satisfaction that I
shall,&rsquo; he returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;I only wish I knew the
best way!&nbsp; Let me alone, and I&rsquo;ll plan it out: while
I&rsquo;m thinking of that I don&rsquo;t feel pain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert
you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m annoyed how I should dream of chattering on
at such a rate; and your gruel cold, and you nodding for
bed!&nbsp; I could have told Heathcliff&rsquo;s history, all that
you need hear, in half a dozen words.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Thus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose, and proceeded
to lay aside her sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the
hearth, and I was very far from nodding.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sit still,
Mrs. Dean,&rsquo; I cried; &lsquo;do sit still another
half-hour.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve done just right to tell the story
leisurely.&nbsp; That is the method I like; and you must finish
it in the same style.&nbsp; I am interested in every character
you have mentioned, more or less.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No matter&mdash;I&rsquo;m not accustomed to go to bed
in the long hours.&nbsp; One or two is early enough for a person
who lies till ten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t lie till ten.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
the very prime of the morning gone long before that time.&nbsp; A
person who has not done one-half his day&rsquo;s work by ten
o&rsquo;clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half
undone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair; because
to-morrow I intend lengthening the night till afternoon.&nbsp; I
prognosticate for myself an obstinate cold, at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope not, sir.&nbsp; Well, you must allow me to leap
over some three years; during that space Mrs.
Earnshaw&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, I&rsquo;ll allow nothing of the sort!&nbsp; Are
you acquainted with the mood of mind in which, if you were seated
alone, and the cat licking its kitten on the rug before you, you
would watch the operation so intently that puss&rsquo;s neglect
of one ear would put you seriously out of temper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A terribly lazy mood, I should say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the contrary, a tiresomely active one.&nbsp; It is
mine, at present; and, therefore, continue minutely.&nbsp; I
perceive that people in these regions acquire over people in
towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does over a spider in
a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the deepened
attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the
looker-on.&nbsp; They <i>do</i> live more in earnest, more in
themselves, and less in surface, change, and frivolous external
things.&nbsp; I could fancy a love for life here almost possible;
and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love of a year&rsquo;s
standing.&nbsp; One state resembles setting a hungry man down to
a single dish, on which he may concentrate his entire appetite
and do it justice; the other, introducing him to a table laid out
by French cooks: he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from
the whole; but each part is a mere atom in his regard and
remembrance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get
to know us,&rsquo; observed Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my
speech.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excuse me,&rsquo; I responded; &lsquo;you, my good
friend, are a striking evidence against that assertion.&nbsp;
Excepting a few provincialisms of slight consequence, you have no
marks of the manners which I am habituated to consider as
peculiar to your class.&nbsp; I am sure you have thought a great
deal more than the generality of servants think.&nbsp; You have
been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of
occasions for frittering your life away in silly
trifles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dean laughed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of
body,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;not exactly from living among the
hills and seeing one set of faces, and one series of actions,
from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end; but I have undergone
sharp discipline, which has taught me wisdom; and then, I have
read more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood.&nbsp; You could not
open a book in this library that I have not looked into, and got
something out of also: unless it be that range of Greek and
Latin, and that of French; and those I know one from another: it
is as much as you can expect of a poor man&rsquo;s
daughter.&nbsp; However, if I am to follow my story in true
gossip&rsquo;s fashion, I had better go on; and instead of
leaping three years, I will be content to pass to the next
summer&mdash;the summer of 1778, that is nearly twenty-three
years ago.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>On the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little
nursling, and the last of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was
born.&nbsp; We were busy with the hay in a far-away field, when
the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour
too soon across the meadow and up the lane, calling me as she
ran.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, such a grand bairn!&rsquo; she panted out.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The finest lad that ever breathed!&nbsp; But the doctor
says missis must go: he says she&rsquo;s been in a consumption
these many months.&nbsp; I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now
she has nothing to keep her, and she&rsquo;ll be dead before
winter.&nbsp; You must come home directly.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re to
nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar and milk, and take care of
it day and night.&nbsp; I wish I were you, because it will be all
yours when there is no missis!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But is she very ill?&rsquo; I asked, flinging down my
rake and tying my bonnet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I guess she is; yet she looks bravely,&rsquo; replied
the girl, &lsquo;and she talks as if she thought of living to see
it grow a man.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s out of her head for joy,
it&rsquo;s such a beauty!&nbsp; If I were her I&rsquo;m certain I
should not die: I should get better at the bare sight of it, in
spite of Kenneth.&nbsp; I was fairly mad at him.&nbsp; Dame
Archer brought the cherub down to master, in the house, and his
face just began to light up, when the old croaker steps forward,
and says he&mdash;&ldquo;Earnshaw, it&rsquo;s a blessing your
wife has been spared to leave you this son.&nbsp; When she came,
I felt convinced we shouldn&rsquo;t keep her long; and now, I
must tell you, the winter will probably finish her.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t take on, and fret about it too much: it can&rsquo;t
be helped.&nbsp; And besides, you should have known better than
to choose such a rush of a lass!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what did the master answer?&rsquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think he swore: but I didn&rsquo;t mind him, I was
straining to see the bairn,&rsquo; and she began again to
describe it rapturously.&nbsp; I, as zealous as herself, hurried
eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was very sad for
Hindley&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; He had room in his heart only for two
idols&mdash;his wife and himself: he doted on both, and adored
one, and I couldn&rsquo;t conceive how he would bear the
loss.</p>
<p>When we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front
door; and, as I passed in, I asked, &lsquo;how was the
baby?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nearly ready to run about, Nell!&rsquo; he replied,
putting on a cheerful smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the mistress?&rsquo; I ventured to inquire;
&lsquo;the doctor says she&rsquo;s&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damn the doctor!&rsquo; he interrupted,
reddening.&nbsp; &lsquo;Frances is quite right: she&rsquo;ll be
perfectly well by this time next week.&nbsp; Are you going
up-stairs? will you tell her that I&rsquo;ll come, if
she&rsquo;ll promise not to talk.&nbsp; I left her because she
would not hold her tongue; and she must&mdash;tell her Mr.
Kenneth says she must be quiet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed in
flighty spirits, and replied merrily, &lsquo;I hardly spoke a
word, Ellen, and there he has gone out twice, crying.&nbsp; Well,
say I promise I won&rsquo;t speak: but that does not bind me not
to laugh at him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor soul!&nbsp; Till within a week of her death that gay
heart never failed her; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay,
furiously, in affirming her health improved every day.&nbsp; When
Kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage
of the malady, and he needn&rsquo;t put him to further expense by
attending her, he retorted, &lsquo;I know you need
not&mdash;she&rsquo;s well&mdash;she does not want any more
attendance from you!&nbsp; She never was in a consumption.&nbsp;
It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse is as slow as mine now,
and her cheek as cool.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe
him; but one night, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of
saying she thought she should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit
of coughing took her&mdash;a very slight one&mdash;he raised her
in his arms; she put her two hands about his neck, her face
changed, and she was dead.</p>
<p>As the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly
into my hands.&nbsp; Mr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy
and never heard him cry, was contented, as far as regarded
him.&nbsp; For himself, he grew desperate: his sorrow was of that
kind that will not lament.&nbsp; He neither wept nor prayed; he
cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave himself up to
reckless dissipation.&nbsp; The servants could not bear his
tyrannical and evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two
that would stay.&nbsp; I had not the heart to leave my charge;
and besides, you know, I had been his foster-sister, and excused
his behaviour more readily than a stranger would.&nbsp; Joseph
remained to hector over tenants and labourers; and because it was
his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to
reprove.</p>
<p>The master&rsquo;s bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty
example for Catherine and Heathcliff.&nbsp; His treatment of the
latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint.&nbsp; And, truly,
it appeared as if the lad <i>were</i> possessed of something
diabolical at that period.&nbsp; He delighted to witness Hindley
degrading himself past redemption; and became daily more notable
for savage sullenness and ferocity.&nbsp; I could not half tell
what an infernal house we had.&nbsp; The curate dropped calling,
and nobody decent came near us, at last; unless Edgar
Linton&rsquo;s visits to Miss Cathy might be an exception.&nbsp;
At fifteen she was the queen of the country-side; she had no
peer; and she did turn out a haughty, headstrong creature!&nbsp;
I own I did not like her, after infancy was past; and I vexed her
frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance: she never took
an aversion to me, though.&nbsp; She had a wondrous constancy to
old attachments: even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections
unalterably; and young Linton, with all his superiority, found it
difficult to make an equally deep impression.&nbsp; He was my
late master: that is his portrait over the fireplace.&nbsp; It
used to hang on one side, and his wife&rsquo;s on the other; but
hers has been removed, or else you might see something of what
she was.&nbsp; Can you make that out?</p>
<p>Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured
face, exceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but
more pensive and amiable in expression.&nbsp; It formed a sweet
picture.&nbsp; The long light hair curled slightly on the
temples; the eyes were large and serious; the figure almost too
graceful.&nbsp; I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw could
forget her first friend for such an individual.&nbsp; I marvelled
much how he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could
fancy my idea of Catherine Earnshaw.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very agreeable portrait,&rsquo; I observed to the
house-keeper.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is it like?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she answered; &lsquo;but he looked better
when he was animated; that is his everyday countenance: he wanted
spirit in general.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since
her five-weeks&rsquo; residence among them; and as she had no
temptation to show her rough side in their company, and had the
sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such
invariable courtesy, she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and
gentleman by her ingenious cordiality; gained the admiration of
Isabella, and the heart and soul of her brother: acquisitions
that flattered her from the first&mdash;for she was full of
ambition&mdash;and led her to adopt a double character without
exactly intending to deceive any one.&nbsp; In the place where
she heard Heathcliff termed a &lsquo;vulgar young ruffian,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;worse than a brute,&rsquo; she took care not to act
like him; but at home she had small inclination to practise
politeness that would only be laughed at, and restrain an unruly
nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise.</p>
<p>Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights
openly.&nbsp; He had a terror of Earnshaw&rsquo;s reputation, and
shrunk from encountering him; and yet he was always received with
our best attempts at civility: the master himself avoided
offending him, knowing why he came; and if he could not be
gracious, kept out of the way.&nbsp; I rather think his
appearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not
artful, never played the coquette, and had evidently an objection
to her two friends meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed
contempt of Linton in his presence, she could not half coincide,
as she did in his absence; and when Linton evinced disgust and
antipathy to Heathcliff, she dared not treat his sentiments with
indifference, as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely
any consequence to her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had many a laugh at her
perplexities and untold troubles, which she vainly strove to hide
from my mockery.&nbsp; That sounds ill-natured: but she was so
proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses, till
she should be chastened into more humility.&nbsp; She did bring
herself, finally, to confess, and to confide in me: there was not
a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser.</p>
<p>Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff
presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it.&nbsp;
He had reached the age of sixteen then, I think, and without
having bad features, or being deficient in intellect, he
contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward
repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of.&nbsp;
In the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his
early education: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded
late, had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit
of knowledge, and any love for books or learning.&nbsp; His
childhood&rsquo;s sense of superiority, instilled into him by the
favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was faded away.&nbsp; He struggled
long to keep up an equality with Catherine in her studies, and
yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he yielded
completely; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in
the way of moving upward, when he found he must, necessarily,
sink beneath his former level.&nbsp; Then personal appearance
sympathised with mental deterioration: he acquired a slouching
gait and ignoble look; his naturally reserved disposition was
exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable
moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure, apparently, in exciting
the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintances.</p>
<p>Catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons
of respite from labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness
for her in words, and recoiled with angry suspicion from her
girlish caresses, as if conscious there could be no gratification
in lavishing such marks of affection on him.&nbsp; On the
before-named occasion he came into the house to announce his
intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting Miss Cathy to
arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it into his
head to be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place to
herself, she managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her
brother&rsquo;s absence, and was then preparing to receive
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?&rsquo; asked
Heathcliff.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you going anywhere?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, it is raining,&rsquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why have you that silk frock on, then?&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nobody coming here, I hope?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not that I know of,&rsquo; stammered Miss: &lsquo;but
you should be in the field now, Heathcliff.&nbsp; It is an hour
past dinnertime: I thought you were gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hindley does not often free us from his accursed
presence,&rsquo; observed the boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not
work any more to-day: I&rsquo;ll stay with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, but Joseph will tell,&rsquo; she suggested;
&lsquo;you&rsquo;d better go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone
Crags; it will take him till dark, and he&rsquo;ll never
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down.&nbsp;
Catherine reflected an instant, with knitted brows&mdash;she
found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this
afternoon,&rsquo; she said, at the conclusion of a minute&rsquo;s
silence.&nbsp; &lsquo;As it rains, I hardly expect them; but they
may come, and if they do, you run the risk of being scolded for
no good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,&rsquo; he
persisted; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t turn me out for those pitiful,
silly friends of yours!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m on the point, sometimes,
of complaining that they&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll
not&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That they what?&rsquo; cried Catherine, gazing at him
with a troubled countenance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Nelly!&rsquo; she
added petulantly, jerking her head away from my hands,
&lsquo;you&rsquo;ve combed my hair quite out of curl!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s enough; let me alone.&nbsp; What are you on the
point of complaining about, Heathcliff?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing&mdash;only look at the almanack on that
wall;&rsquo; he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the
window, and continued, &lsquo;The crosses are for the evenings
you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those spent with
me.&nbsp; Do you see?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve marked every
day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;very foolish: as if I took notice!&rsquo;
replied Catherine, in a peevish tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;And where is
the sense of that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To show that I <i>do</i> take notice,&rsquo; said
Heathcliff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And should I always be sitting with you?&rsquo; she
demanded, growing more irritated.&nbsp; &lsquo;What good do I
get?&nbsp; What do you talk about?&nbsp; You might be dumb, or a
baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you do,
either!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You never told me before that I talked too little, or
that you disliked my company, Cathy!&rsquo; exclaimed Heathcliff,
in much agitation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no company at all, when people know nothing
and say nothing,&rsquo; she muttered.</p>
<p>Her companion rose up, but he hadn&rsquo;t time to express his
feelings further, for a horse&rsquo;s feet were heard on the
flags, and having knocked gently, young Linton entered, his face
brilliant with delight at the unexpected summon she had
received.&nbsp; Doubtless Catherine marked the difference between
her friends, as one came in and the other went out.&nbsp; The
contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly,
coal country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and
greeting were as opposite as his aspect.&nbsp; He had a sweet,
low manner of speaking, and pronounced his words as you do:
that&rsquo;s less gruff than we talk here, and softer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not come too soon, am I?&rsquo; he said,
casting a look at me: I had begun to wipe the plate, and tidy
some drawers at the far end in the dresser.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are
you doing there, Nelly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My work, Miss,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; (Mr. Hindley had
given me directions to make a third party in any private visits
Linton chose to pay.)</p>
<p>She stepped behind me and whispered crossly, &lsquo;Take
yourself and your dusters off; when company are in the house,
servants don&rsquo;t commence scouring and cleaning in the room
where they are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a good opportunity, now that master is
away,&rsquo; I answered aloud: &lsquo;he hates me to be fidgeting
over these things in his presence.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Edgar
will excuse me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hate you to be fidgeting in <i>my</i>
presence,&rsquo; exclaimed the young lady imperiously, not
allowing her guest time to speak: she had failed to recover her
equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for it, Miss Catherine,&rsquo; was my
response; and I proceeded assiduously with my occupation.</p>
<p>She, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth
from my hand, and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very
spitefully on the arm.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve said I did not love her,
and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then: besides,
she hurt me extremely; so I started up from my knees, and
screamed out, &lsquo;Oh, Miss, that&rsquo;s a nasty trick!&nbsp;
You have no right to nip me, and I&rsquo;m not going to bear
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t touch you, you lying creature!&rsquo;
cried she, her fingers tingling to repeat the act, and her ears
red with rage.&nbsp; She never had power to conceal her passion,
it always set her whole complexion in a blaze.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that, then?&rsquo; I retorted, showing a
decided purple witness to refute her.</p>
<p>She stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly
impelled by the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the
cheek: a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Catherine, love!&nbsp; Catherine!&rsquo; interposed
Linton, greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and
violence which his idol had committed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leave the room, Ellen!&rsquo; she repeated, trembling
all over.</p>
<p>Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting
near me on the floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying
himself, and sobbed out complaints against &lsquo;wicked aunt
Cathy,&rsquo; which drew her fury on to his unlucky head: she
seized his shoulders, and shook him till the poor child waxed
livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver
him.&nbsp; In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished
young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could
not be mistaken for jest.&nbsp; He drew back in
consternation.&nbsp; I lifted Hareton in my arms, and walked off
to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of communication open,
for I was curious to watch how they would settle their
disagreement.&nbsp; The insulted visitor moved to the spot where
he had laid his hat, pale and with a quivering lip.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rsquo; I said to myself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Take warning and begone!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a kindness to
let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; demanded Catherine,
advancing to the door.</p>
<p>He swerved aside, and attempted to pass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not go!&rsquo; she exclaimed,
energetically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must and shall!&rsquo; he replied in a subdued
voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she persisted, grasping the handle;
&lsquo;not yet, Edgar Linton: sit down; you shall not leave me in
that temper.&nbsp; I should be miserable all night, and I
won&rsquo;t be miserable for you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can I stay after you have struck me?&rsquo; asked
Linton.</p>
<p>Catherine was mute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve made me afraid and ashamed of you,&rsquo;
he continued; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not come here again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you told a deliberate untruth!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she cried, recovering her
speech; &lsquo;I did nothing deliberately.&nbsp; Well, go, if you
please&mdash;get away!&nbsp; And now I&rsquo;ll
cry&mdash;I&rsquo;ll cry myself sick!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping
in serious earnest.&nbsp; Edgar persevered in his resolution as
far as the court; there he lingered.&nbsp; I resolved to
encourage him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,&rsquo; I called
out.&nbsp; &lsquo;As bad as any marred child: you&rsquo;d better
be riding home, or else she will be sick, only to grieve
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The soft thing looked askance through the window: he possessed
the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave
a mouse half killed, or a bird half eaten.&nbsp; Ah, I thought,
there will be no saving him: he&rsquo;s doomed, and flies to his
fate!&nbsp; And so it was: he turned abruptly, hastened into the
house again, shut the door behind him; and when I went in a while
after to inform them that Earnshaw had come home rabid drunk,
ready to pull the whole place about our ears (his ordinary frame
of mind in that condition), I saw the quarrel had merely effected
a closer intimacy&mdash;had broken the outworks of youthful
timidity, and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship,
and confess themselves lovers.</p>
<p>Intelligence of Mr. Hindley&rsquo;s arrival drove Linton
speedily to his horse, and Catherine to her chamber.&nbsp; I went
to hide little Hareton, and to take the shot out of the
master&rsquo;s fowling-piece, which he was fond of playing with
in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of any who
provoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and I had hit
upon the plan of removing it, that he might do less mischief if
he did go the length of firing the gun.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>He entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me
in the act of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard.&nbsp;
Hareton was impressed with a wholesome terror of encountering
either his wild beast&rsquo;s fondness or his madman&rsquo;s
rage; for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and kissed to
death, and in the other of being flung into the fire, or dashed
against the wall; and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet
wherever I chose to put him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, I&rsquo;ve found it out at last!&rsquo; cried
Hindley, pulling me back by the skin of my neck, like a
dog.&nbsp; &lsquo;By heaven and hell, you&rsquo;ve sworn between
you to murder that child!&nbsp; I know how it is, now, that he is
always out of my way.&nbsp; But, with the help of Satan, I shall
make you swallow the carving-knife, Nelly!&nbsp; You
needn&rsquo;t laugh; for I&rsquo;ve just crammed Kenneth,
head-downmost, in the Black-horse marsh; and two is the same as
one&mdash;and I want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest
till I do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t like the carving-knife, Mr.
Hindley,&rsquo; I answered; &lsquo;it has been cutting red
herrings.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather be shot, if you
please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d rather be damned!&rsquo; he said;
&lsquo;and so you shall.&nbsp; No law in England can hinder a man
from keeping his house decent, and mine&rsquo;s abominable!&nbsp;
Open your mouth.&rsquo;&nbsp; He held the knife in his hand, and
pushed its point between my teeth: but, for my part, I was never
much afraid of his vagaries.&nbsp; I spat out, and affirmed it
tasted detestably&mdash;I would not take it on any account.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said he, releasing me, &lsquo;I see that
hideous little villain is not Hareton: I beg your pardon,
Nell.&nbsp; If it be, he deserves flaying alive for not running
to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin.&nbsp;
Unnatural cub, come hither!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll teach thee to impose
on a good-hearted, deluded father.&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t you
think the lad would be handsomer cropped?&nbsp; It makes a dog
fiercer, and I love something fierce&mdash;get me a
scissors&mdash;something fierce and trim!&nbsp; Besides,
it&rsquo;s infernal affectation&mdash;devilish conceit it is, to
cherish our ears&mdash;we&rsquo;re asses enough without
them.&nbsp; Hush, child, hush!&nbsp; Well then, it is my darling!
wisht, dry thy eyes&mdash;there&rsquo;s a joy; kiss me.&nbsp;
What! it won&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Kiss me, Hareton!&nbsp; Damn thee,
kiss me!&nbsp; By God, as if I would rear such a monster!&nbsp;
As sure as I&rsquo;m living, I&rsquo;ll break the brat&rsquo;s
neck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father&rsquo;s
arms with all his might, and redoubled his yells when he carried
him up-stairs and lifted him over the banister.&nbsp; I cried out
that he would frighten the child into fits, and ran to rescue
him.&nbsp; As I reached them, Hindley leant forward on the rails
to listen to a noise below; almost forgetting what he had in his
hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who is that?&rsquo; he asked, hearing some
one approaching the stairs&rsquo;-foot.&nbsp; I leant forward
also, for the purpose of signing to Heathcliff, whose step I
recognised, not to come further; and, at the instant when my eye
quitted Hareton, he gave a sudden spring, delivered himself from
the careless grasp that held him, and fell.</p>
<p>There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror
before we saw that the little wretch was safe.&nbsp; Heathcliff
arrived underneath just at the critical moment; by a natural
impulse he arrested his descent, and setting him on his feet,
looked up to discover the author of the accident.&nbsp; A miser
who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five shillings,
and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand
pounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on
beholding the figure of Mr. Earnshaw above.&nbsp; It expressed,
plainer than words could do, the intensest anguish at having made
himself the instrument of thwarting his own revenge.&nbsp; Had it
been dark, I daresay he would have tried to remedy the mistake by
smashing Hareton&rsquo;s skull on the steps; but, we witnessed
his salvation; and I was presently below with my precious charge
pressed to my heart.&nbsp; Hindley descended more leisurely,
sobered and abashed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is your fault, Ellen,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you
should have kept him out of sight: you should have taken him from
me!&nbsp; Is he injured anywhere?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Injured!&rsquo; I cried angrily; &lsquo;if he is not
killed, he&rsquo;ll be an idiot!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I wonder his
mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re worse than a heathen&mdash;treating your own flesh
and blood in that manner!&rsquo;&nbsp; He attempted to touch the
child, who, on finding himself with me, sobbed off his terror
directly.&nbsp; At the first finger his father laid on him,
however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as
if he would go into convulsions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall not meddle with him!&rsquo; I
continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;He hates you&mdash;they all hate
you&mdash;that&rsquo;s the truth!&nbsp; A happy family you have;
and a pretty state you&rsquo;re come to!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,&rsquo; laughed
the misguided man, recovering his hardness.&nbsp; &lsquo;At
present, convey yourself and him away.&nbsp; And hark you,
Heathcliff! clear you too quite from my reach and hearing.&nbsp;
I wouldn&rsquo;t murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the
house on fire: but that&rsquo;s as my fancy goes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the
dresser, and poured some into a tumbler.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; I entreated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr.
Hindley, do take warning.&nbsp; Have mercy on this unfortunate
boy, if you care nothing for yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any one will do better for him than I shall,&rsquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have mercy on your own soul!&rsquo; I said,
endeavouring to snatch the glass from his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I!&nbsp; On the contrary, I shall have great
pleasure in sending it to perdition to punish its Maker,&rsquo;
exclaimed the blasphemer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to its hearty
damnation!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating
his command with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to
repeat or remember.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pity he cannot kill himself with
drink,&rsquo; observed Heathcliff, muttering an echo of curses
back when the door was shut.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s doing his
very utmost; but his constitution defies him.&nbsp; Mr. Kenneth
says he would wager his mare that he&rsquo;ll outlive any man on
this side Gimmerton, and go to the grave a hoary sinner; unless
some happy chance out of the common course befall him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb
to sleep.&nbsp; Heathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the
barn.&nbsp; It turned out afterwards that he only got as far as
the other side the settle, when he flung himself on a bench by
the wall, removed from the fire and remained silent.</p>
<p>I was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that
began,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>It was far in the night, and the bairnies grat,<br
/>
The mither beneath the mools heard that,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room,
put her head in, and whispered,&mdash;&lsquo;Are you alone,
Nelly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Miss,&rsquo; I replied.</p>
<p>She entered and approached the hearth.&nbsp; I, supposing she
was going to say something, looked up.&nbsp; The expression of
her face seemed disturbed and anxious.&nbsp; Her lips were half
asunder, as if she meant to speak, and she drew a breath; but it
escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence.&nbsp; I resumed my song;
not having forgotten her recent behaviour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Heathcliff?&rsquo; she said, interrupting
me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About his work in the stable,&rsquo; was my answer.</p>
<p>He did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a
doze.&nbsp; There followed another long pause, during which I
perceived a drop or two trickle from Catherine&rsquo;s cheek to
the flags.&nbsp; Is she sorry for her shameful conduct?&mdash;I
asked myself.&nbsp; That will be a novelty: but she may come to
the point&mdash;as she will&mdash;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t help
her!&nbsp; No, she felt small trouble regarding any subject, save
her own concerns.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo; she cried at last.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m very unhappy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A pity,&rsquo; observed I.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
hard to please; so many friends and so few cares, and can&rsquo;t
make yourself content!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?&rsquo; she
pursued, kneeling down by me, and lifting her winsome eyes to my
face with that sort of look which turns off bad temper, even when
one has all the right in the world to indulge it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it worth keeping?&rsquo; I inquired, less
sulkily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out!&nbsp; I
want to know what I should do.&nbsp; To-day, Edgar Linton has
asked me to marry him, and I&rsquo;ve given him an answer.&nbsp;
Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or denial, you
tell me which it ought to have been.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?&rsquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;To be sure, considering the exhibition you
performed in his presence this afternoon, I might say it would be
wise to refuse him: since he asked you after that, he must either
be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome fool.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you talk so, I won&rsquo;t tell you any more,&rsquo;
she returned, peevishly rising to her feet.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
accepted him, Nelly.&nbsp; Be quick, and say whether I was
wrong!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You accepted him!&nbsp; Then what good is it discussing
the matter?&nbsp; You have pledged your word, and cannot
retract.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But say whether I should have done so&mdash;do!&rsquo;
she exclaimed in an irritated tone; chafing her hands together,
and frowning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are many things to be considered before that
question can be answered properly,&rsquo; I said,
sententiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;First and foremost, do you love Mr.
Edgar?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who can help it?&nbsp; Of course I do,&rsquo; she
answered.</p>
<p>Then I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of
twenty-two it was not injudicious.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, I do&mdash;that&rsquo;s
sufficient.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By no means; you must say why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be
with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bad!&rsquo; was my commentary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And because he is young and cheerful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bad, still.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And because he loves me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indifferent, coming there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the
greatest woman of the neighbourhood, and I shall be proud of
having such a husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Worst of all.&nbsp; And now, say how you love
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As everybody loves&mdash;You&rsquo;re silly,
Nelly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all&mdash;Answer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his
head, and everything he touches, and every word he says.&nbsp; I
love all his looks, and all his actions, and him entirely and
altogether.&nbsp; There now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly
ill-natured!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no jest to me!&rsquo; said the
young lady, scowling, and turning her face to the fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,&rsquo;
I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;You love Mr. Edgar because he is
handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and loves you.&nbsp;
The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him without
that, probably; and with it you wouldn&rsquo;t, unless he
possessed the four former attractions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, to be sure not: I should only pity him&mdash;hate
him, perhaps, if he were ugly, and a clown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there are several other handsome, rich young men in
the world: handsomer, possibly, and richer than he is.&nbsp; What
should hinder you from loving them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If there be any, they are out of my way: I&rsquo;ve
seen none like Edgar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may see some; and he won&rsquo;t always be
handsome, and young, and may not always be rich.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is now; and I have only to do with the
present.&nbsp; I wish you would speak rationally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that settles it: if you have only to do with the
present, marry Mr. Linton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want your permission for that&mdash;I
<i>shall</i> marry him: and yet you have not told me whether
I&rsquo;m right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perfectly right; if people be right to marry only for
the present.&nbsp; And now, let us hear what you are unhappy
about.&nbsp; Your brother will be pleased; the old lady and
gentleman will not object, I think; you will escape from a
disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable one; and
you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you.&nbsp; All seems smooth and
easy: where is the obstacle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Here</i>! and <i>here</i>!&rsquo; replied Catherine,
striking one hand on her forehead, and the other on her breast:
&lsquo;in whichever place the soul lives.&nbsp; In my soul and in
my heart, I&rsquo;m convinced I&rsquo;m wrong!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s very strange!&nbsp; I cannot make it
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s my secret.&nbsp; But if you will not mock at
me, I&rsquo;ll explain it: I can&rsquo;t do it distinctly; but
I&rsquo;ll give you a feeling of how I feel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She seated herself by me again: her countenance grew sadder
and graver, and her clasped hands trembled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?&rsquo; she
said, suddenly, after some minutes&rsquo; reflection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, now and then,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so do I.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve dreamt in my life dreams
that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas:
they&rsquo;ve gone through and through me, like wine through
water, and altered the colour of my mind.&nbsp; And this is one:
I&rsquo;m going to tell it&mdash;but take care not to smile at
any part of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t, Miss Catherine!&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We&rsquo;re dismal enough without conjuring up ghosts and
visions to perplex us.&nbsp; Come, come, be merry and like
yourself!&nbsp; Look at little Hareton! <i>he&rsquo;s</i>
dreaming nothing dreary.&nbsp; How sweetly he smiles in his
sleep!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his
solitude!&nbsp; You remember him, I daresay, when he was just
such another as that chubby thing: nearly as young and
innocent.&nbsp; However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to listen:
it&rsquo;s not long; and I&rsquo;ve no power to be merry
to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t hear it, I won&rsquo;t hear it!&rsquo; I
repeated, hastily.</p>
<p>I was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and
Catherine had an unusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread
something from which I might shape a prophecy, and foresee a
fearful catastrophe.&nbsp; She was vexed, but she did not
proceed.&nbsp; Apparently taking up another subject, she
recommenced in a short time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely
miserable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because you are not fit to go there,&rsquo; I
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;All sinners would be miserable in
heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is not for that.&nbsp; I dreamt once that I was
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you I won&rsquo;t hearken to your dreams, Miss
Catherine!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go to bed,&rsquo; I interrupted
again.</p>
<p>She laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my
chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is nothing,&rsquo; cried she: &lsquo;I was only
going to say that heaven did not seem to be my home; and I broke
my heart with weeping to come back to earth; and the angels were
so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on
the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing for joy.&nbsp;
That will do to explain my secret, as well as the other.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to
be in heaven; and if the wicked man in there had not brought
Heathcliff so low, I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought of it.&nbsp; It
would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know
how I love him: and that, not because he&rsquo;s handsome, Nelly,
but because he&rsquo;s more myself than I am.&nbsp; Whatever our
souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton&rsquo;s
is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from
fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff&rsquo;s
presence.&nbsp; Having noticed a slight movement, I turned my
head, and saw him rise from the bench, and steal out
noiselessly.&nbsp; He had listened till he heard Catherine say it
would degrade her to marry him, and then he stayed to hear no
further.&nbsp; My companion, sitting on the ground, was prevented
by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or
departure; but I started, and bade her hush!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; she asked, gazing nervously round.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Joseph is here,&rsquo; I answered, catching opportunely
the roll of his cartwheels up the road; &lsquo;and Heathcliff
will come in with him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure whether he were
not at the door this moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, he couldn&rsquo;t overhear me at the door!&rsquo;
said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Give me Hareton, while you get the supper,
and when it is ready ask me to sup with you.&nbsp; I want to
cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that
Heathcliff has no notion of these things.&nbsp; He has not, has
he?&nbsp; He does not know what being in love is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see no reason that he should not know, as well as
you,&rsquo; I returned; &lsquo;and if you are his choice,
he&rsquo;ll be the most unfortunate creature that ever was
born!&nbsp; As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend,
and love, and all!&nbsp; Have you considered how you&rsquo;ll
bear the separation, and how he&rsquo;ll bear to be quite
deserted in the world?&nbsp; Because, Miss
Catherine&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He quite deserted! we separated!&rsquo; she exclaimed,
with an accent of indignation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who is to separate
us, pray?&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll meet the fate of Milo!&nbsp; Not as
long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature.&nbsp; Every Linton
on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could
consent to forsake Heathcliff.&nbsp; Oh, that&rsquo;s not what I
intend&mdash;that&rsquo;s not what I mean!&nbsp; I
shouldn&rsquo;t be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded!&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll be as much to me as he has been all his
lifetime.&nbsp; Edgar must shake off his antipathy, and tolerate
him, at least.&nbsp; He will, when he learns my true feelings
towards him.&nbsp; Nelly, I see now you think me a selfish
wretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I
married, we should be beggars? whereas, if I marry Linton I can
aid Heathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother&rsquo;s
power.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With your husband&rsquo;s money, Miss Catherine?&rsquo;
I asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find him not so pliable as you
calculate upon: and, though I&rsquo;m hardly a judge, I think
that&rsquo;s the worst motive you&rsquo;ve given yet for being
the wife of young Linton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not,&rsquo; retorted she; &lsquo;it is the
best!&nbsp; The others were the satisfaction of my whims: and for
Edgar&rsquo;s sake, too, to satisfy him.&nbsp; This is for the
sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings to Edgar
and myself.&nbsp; I cannot express it; but surely you and
everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence
of yours beyond you.&nbsp; What were the use of my creation, if I
were entirely contained here?&nbsp; My great miseries in this
world have been Heathcliff&rsquo;s miseries, and I watched and
felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is
himself.&nbsp; If all else perished, and <i>he</i> remained,
<i>I</i> should still continue to be; and if all else remained,
and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty
stranger: I should not seem a part of it.&mdash;My love for
Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it,
I&rsquo;m well aware, as winter changes the trees.&nbsp; My love
for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of
little visible delight, but necessary.&nbsp; Nelly, I <i>am</i>
Heathcliff!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s always, always in my mind: not as a
pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as
my own being.&nbsp; So don&rsquo;t talk of our separation again:
it is impracticable; and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>She paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I
jerked it forcibly away.&nbsp; I was out of patience with her
folly!</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss,&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;it only goes to convince me that you are ignorant
of the duties you undertake in marrying; or else that you are a
wicked, unprincipled girl.&nbsp; But trouble me with no more
secrets: I&rsquo;ll not promise to keep them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll keep that?&rsquo; she asked, eagerly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll not promise,&rsquo; I repeated.</p>
<p>She was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished
our conversation; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner, and
nursed Hareton, while I made the supper.&nbsp; After it was
cooked, my fellow-servant and I began to quarrel who should carry
some to Mr. Hindley; and we didn&rsquo;t settle it till all was
nearly cold.&nbsp; Then we came to the agreement that we would
let him ask, if he wanted any; for we feared particularly to go
into his presence when he had been some time alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how isn&rsquo;t that nowt comed in fro&rsquo;
th&rsquo; field, be this time?&nbsp; What is he about? girt idle
seeght!&rsquo; demanded the old man, looking round for
Heathcliff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll call him,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s in the barn, I&rsquo;ve no doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I went and called, but got no answer.&nbsp; On returning, I
whispered to Catherine that he had heard a good part of what she
said, I was sure; and told how I saw him quit the kitchen just as
she complained of her brother&rsquo;s conduct regarding
him.&nbsp; She jumped up in a fine fright, flung Hareton on to
the settle, and ran to seek for her friend herself; not taking
leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how her talk
would have affected him.&nbsp; She was absent such a while that
Joseph proposed we should wait no longer.&nbsp; He cunningly
conjectured they were staying away in order to avoid hearing his
protracted blessing.&nbsp; They were &lsquo;ill eneugh for ony
fahl manners,&rsquo; he affirmed.&nbsp; And on their behalf he
added that night a special prayer to the usual
quarter-of-an-hour&rsquo;s supplication before meat, and would
have tacked another to the end of the grace, had not his young
mistress broken in upon him with a hurried command that he must
run down the road, and, wherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and
make him re-enter directly!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to speak to him, and I <i>must</i>, before I go
upstairs,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And the gate is open: he
is somewhere out of hearing; for he would not reply, though I
shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joseph objected at first; she was too much in earnest,
however, to suffer contradiction; and at last he placed his hat
on his head, and walked grumbling forth.&nbsp; Meantime,
Catherine paced up and down the floor, exclaiming&mdash;&lsquo;I
wonder where he is&mdash;I wonder where he can be!&nbsp; What did
I say, Nelly?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve forgotten.&nbsp; Was he vexed at
my bad humour this afternoon?&nbsp; Dear! tell me what I&rsquo;ve
said to grieve him?&nbsp; I do wish he&rsquo;d come.&nbsp; I do
wish he would!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a noise for nothing!&rsquo; I cried, though rather
uneasy myself.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a trifle scares you!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s surely no great cause of alarm that Heathcliff should
take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie too sulky to
speak to us in the hay-loft.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll engage he&rsquo;s
lurking there.&nbsp; See if I don&rsquo;t ferret him
out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment,
and Joseph&rsquo;s quest ended in the same.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yon lad gets war und war!&rsquo; observed he on
re-entering.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s left th&rsquo; gate at
t&rsquo; full swing, and Miss&rsquo;s pony has trodden dahn two
rigs o&rsquo; corn, and plottered through, raight o&rsquo;er into
t&rsquo; meadow!&nbsp; Hahsomdiver, t&rsquo; maister &lsquo;ull
play t&rsquo; devil to-morn, and he&rsquo;ll do weel.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s patience itsseln wi&rsquo; sich careless, offald
craters&mdash;patience itsseln he is!&nbsp; Bud he&rsquo;ll not
be soa allus&mdash;yah&rsquo;s see, all on ye!&nbsp; Yah
mun&rsquo;n&rsquo;t drive him out of his heead for
nowt!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you found Heathcliff, you ass?&rsquo; interrupted
Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you been looking for him, as I
ordered?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I sud more likker look for th&rsquo; horse,&rsquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;It &rsquo;ud be to more sense.&nbsp; Bud I
can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike
this&mdash;as black as t&rsquo; chimbley! und Heathcliff&rsquo;s
noan t&rsquo; chap to coom at <i>my</i> whistle&mdash;happen
he&rsquo;ll be less hard o&rsquo; hearing wi&rsquo;
<i>ye</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> a very dark evening for summer: the clouds
appeared inclined to thunder, and I said we had better all sit
down; the approaching rain would be certain to bring him home
without further trouble.&nbsp; However, Catherine would not be
persuaded into tranquillity.&nbsp; She kept wandering to and fro,
from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which
permitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation
on one side of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my
expostulations and the growling thunder, and the great drops that
began to plash around her, she remained, calling at intervals,
and then listening, and then crying outright.&nbsp; She beat
Hareton, or any child, at a good passionate fit of crying.</p>
<p>About midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling
over the Heights in full fury.&nbsp; There was a violent wind, as
well as thunder, and either one or the other split a tree off at
the corner of the building: a huge bough fell across the roof,
and knocked down a portion of the east chimney-stack, sending a
clatter of stones and soot into the kitchen-fire.&nbsp; We
thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and Joseph swung
on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the patriarchs
Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous,
though he smote the ungodly.&nbsp; I felt some sentiment that it
must be a judgment on us also.&nbsp; The Jonah, in my mind, was
Mr. Earnshaw; and I shook the handle of his den that I might
ascertain if he were yet living.&nbsp; He replied audibly enough,
in a fashion which made my companion vociferate, more clamorously
than before, that a wide distinction might be drawn between
saints like himself and sinners like his master.&nbsp; But the
uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed;
excepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in
refusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawlless
to catch as much water as she could with her hair and
clothes.&nbsp; She came in and lay down on the settle, all soaked
as she was, turning her face to the back, and putting her hands
before it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Miss!&rsquo; I exclaimed, touching her shoulder;
&lsquo;you are not bent on getting your death, are you?&nbsp; Do
you know what o&rsquo;clock it is?&nbsp; Half-past twelve.&nbsp;
Come, come to bed! there&rsquo;s no use waiting any longer on
that foolish boy: he&rsquo;ll be gone to Gimmerton, and
he&rsquo;ll stay there now.&nbsp; He guesses we shouldn&rsquo;t
wait for him till this late hour: at least, he guesses that only
Mr. Hindley would be up; and he&rsquo;d rather avoid having the
door opened by the master.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, nay, he&rsquo;s noan at Gimmerton,&rsquo; said
Joseph.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;s niver wonder but he&rsquo;s at
t&rsquo; bothom of a bog-hoile.&nbsp; This visitation
worn&rsquo;t for nowt, and I wod hev&rsquo; ye to look out,
Miss&mdash;yah muh be t&rsquo; next.&nbsp; Thank Hivin for
all!&nbsp; All warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen,
and piked out fro&rsquo; th&rsquo; rubbidge!&nbsp; Yah knaw whet
t&rsquo; Scripture ses.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he began quoting several
texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we might find
them.</p>
<p>I, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her
wet things, left him preaching and her shivering, and betook
myself to bed with little Hareton, who slept as fast as if
everyone had been sleeping round him.&nbsp; I heard Joseph read
on a while afterwards; then I distinguished his slow step on the
ladder, and then I dropped asleep.</p>
<p>Coming down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams
piercing the chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated
near the fireplace.&nbsp; The house-door was ajar, too; light
entered from its unclosed windows; Hindley had come out, and
stood on the kitchen hearth, haggard and drowsy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What ails you, Cathy?&rsquo; he was saying when I
entered: &lsquo;you look as dismal as a drowned whelp.&nbsp; Why
are you so damp and pale, child?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been wet,&rsquo; she answered reluctantly,
&lsquo;and I&rsquo;m cold, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, she is naughty!&rsquo; I cried, perceiving the
master to be tolerably sober.&nbsp; &lsquo;She got steeped in the
shower of yesterday evening, and there she has sat the night
through, and I couldn&rsquo;t prevail on her to stir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;The night
through,&rsquo; he repeated.&nbsp; &lsquo;What kept her up? not
fear of the thunder, surely?&nbsp; That was over hours
since.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Neither of us wished to mention Heathcliff&rsquo;s absence, as
long as we could conceal it; so I replied, I didn&rsquo;t know
how she took it into her head to sit up; and she said
nothing.&nbsp; The morning was fresh and cool; I threw back the
lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents from the
garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, &lsquo;Ellen, shut
the window.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m starving!&rsquo;&nbsp; And her teeth
chattered as she shrank closer to the almost extinguished
embers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s ill,&rsquo; said Hindley, taking her wrist;
&lsquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s the reason she would not go to
bed.&nbsp; Damn it!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to be troubled with
more sickness here.&nbsp; What took you into the rain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Running after t&rsquo; lads, as usuald!&rsquo; croaked
Joseph, catching an opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in
his evil tongue.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I war yah, maister, I&rsquo;d
just slam t&rsquo; boards i&rsquo; their faces all on &rsquo;em,
gentle and simple!&nbsp; Never a day ut yah&rsquo;re off, but yon
cat o&rsquo; Linton comes sneaking hither; and Miss Nelly,
shoo&rsquo;s a fine lass! shoo sits watching for ye i&rsquo;
t&rsquo; kitchen; and as yah&rsquo;re in at one door, he&rsquo;s
out at t&rsquo;other; and, then, wer grand lady goes a-courting
of her side!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s bonny behaviour, lurking amang
t&rsquo; fields, after twelve o&rsquo; t&rsquo; night, wi&rsquo;
that fahl, flaysome divil of a gipsy, Heathcliff!&nbsp; They
think <i>I&rsquo;m</i> blind; but I&rsquo;m noan: nowt ut
t&rsquo; soart!&mdash;I seed young Linton boath coming and going,
and I seed <i>yah</i>&rsquo; (directing his discourse to me),
&lsquo;yah gooid fur nowt, slattenly witch! nip up and bolt into
th&rsquo; house, t&rsquo; minute yah heard t&rsquo;
maister&rsquo;s horse-fit clatter up t&rsquo; road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silence, eavesdropper!&rsquo; cried Catherine;
&lsquo;none of your insolence before me!&nbsp; Edgar Linton came
yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was <i>I</i> who told him to
be off: because I knew you would not like to have met him as you
were.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You lie, Cathy, no doubt,&rsquo; answered her brother,
&lsquo;and you are a confounded simpleton!&nbsp; But never mind
Linton at present: tell me, were you not with Heathcliff last
night?&nbsp; Speak the truth, now.&nbsp; You need not be afraid
of harming him: though I hate him as much as ever, he did me a
good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender
of breaking his neck.&nbsp; To prevent it, I shall send him about
his business this very morning; and after he&rsquo;s gone,
I&rsquo;d advise you all to look sharp: I shall only have the
more humour for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never saw Heathcliff last night,&rsquo; answered
Catherine, beginning to sob bitterly: &lsquo;and if you do turn
him out of doors, I&rsquo;ll go with him.&nbsp; But, perhaps,
you&rsquo;ll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he&rsquo;s
gone.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here she burst into uncontrollable grief, and
the remainder of her words were inarticulate.</p>
<p>Hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade
her get to her room immediately, or she shouldn&rsquo;t cry for
nothing!&nbsp; I obliged her to obey; and I shall never forget
what a scene she acted when we reached her chamber: it terrified
me.&nbsp; I thought she was going mad, and I begged Joseph to run
for the doctor.&nbsp; It proved the commencement of delirium: Mr.
Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her dangerously ill;
she had a fever.&nbsp; He bled her, and he told me to let her
live on whey and water-gruel, and take care she did not throw
herself downstairs or out of the window; and then he left: for he
had enough to do in the parish, where two or three miles was the
ordinary distance between cottage and cottage.</p>
<p>Though I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the
master were no better, and though our patient was as wearisome
and headstrong as a patient could be, she weathered it
through.&nbsp; Old Mrs. Linton paid us several visits, to be
sure, and set things to rights, and scolded and ordered us all;
and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted on conveying
her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were very
grateful.&nbsp; But the poor dame had reason to repent of her
kindness: she and her husband both took the fever, and died
within a few days of each other.</p>
<p>Our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and
haughtier than ever.&nbsp; Heathcliff had never been heard of
since the evening of the thunder-storm; and, one day, I had the
misfortune, when she had provoked me exceedingly, to lay the
blame of his disappearance on her: where indeed it belonged, as
she well knew.&nbsp; From that period, for several months, she
ceased to hold any communication with me, save in the relation of
a mere servant.&nbsp; Joseph fell under a ban also: he would
speak his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a
little girl; and she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress,
and thought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be
treated with consideration.&nbsp; Then the doctor had said that
she would not bear crossing much; she ought to have her own way;
and it was nothing less than murder in her eyes for any one to
presume to stand up and contradict her.&nbsp; From Mr. Earnshaw
and his companions she kept aloof; and tutored by Kenneth, and
serious threats of a fit that often attended her rages, her
brother allowed her whatever she pleased to demand, and generally
avoided aggravating her fiery temper.&nbsp; He was rather too
indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection, but from
pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family
by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him alone
she might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared!&nbsp;
Edgar Linton, as multitudes have been before and will be after
him, was infatuated: and believed himself the happiest man alive
on the day he led her to Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent
to his father&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Much against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave
Wuthering Heights and accompany her here. Little Hareton was
nearly five years old, and I had just begun to teach him his
letters.&nbsp; We made a sad parting; but Catherine&rsquo;s tears
were more powerful than ours.&nbsp; When I refused to go, and
when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting
to her husband and brother.&nbsp; The former offered me
munificent wages; the latter ordered me to pack up: he wanted no
women in the house, he said, now that there was no mistress; and
as to Hareton, the curate should take him in hand,
by-and-by.&nbsp; And so I had but one choice left: to do as I was
ordered.&nbsp; I told the master he got rid of all decent people
only to run to ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said
good-by; and since then he has been a stranger: and it&rsquo;s
very queer to think it, but I&rsquo;ve no doubt he has completely
forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and that he was ever more than
all the world to her and she to him!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>At this point of the housekeeper&rsquo;s story she chanced to
glance towards the time-piece over the chimney; and was in
amazement on seeing the minute-hand measure half-past one.&nbsp;
She would not hear of staying a second longer: in truth, I felt
rather disposed to defer the sequel of her narrative
myself.&nbsp; And now that she is vanished to her rest, and I
have meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to
go also, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>A charming introduction to a hermit&rsquo;s life!&nbsp; Four
weeks&rsquo; torture, tossing, and sickness!&nbsp; Oh, these
bleak winds and bitter northern skies, and impassable roads, and
dilatory country surgeons!&nbsp; And oh, this dearth of the human
physiognomy! and, worse than all, the terrible intimation of
Kenneth that I need not expect to be out of doors till
spring!</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call.&nbsp; About
seven days ago he sent me a brace of grouse&mdash;the last of the
season.&nbsp; Scoundrel!&nbsp; He is not altogether guiltless in
this illness of mine; and that I had a great mind to tell
him.&nbsp; But, alas! how could I offend a man who was charitable
enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some other
subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches?&nbsp; This
is quite an easy interval.&nbsp; I am too weak to read; yet I
feel as if I could enjoy something interesting.&nbsp; Why not
have up Mrs. Dean to finish her tale?&nbsp; I can recollect its
chief incidents, as far as she had gone.&nbsp; Yes: I remember
her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three years;
and the heroine was married.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll ring: she&rsquo;ll
be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully.&nbsp; Mrs.
Dean came.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the
medicine,&rsquo; she commenced.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Away, away with it!&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;I desire
to have&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The doctor says you must drop the powders.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With all my heart!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t interrupt
me.&nbsp; Come and take your seat here.&nbsp; Keep your fingers
from that bitter phalanx of vials.&nbsp; Draw your knitting out
of your pocket&mdash;that will do&mdash;now continue the history
of Mr. Heathcliff, from where you left off, to the present
day.&nbsp; Did he finish his education on the Continent, and come
back a gentleman? or did he get a sizar&rsquo;s place at college,
or escape to America, and earn honours by drawing blood from his
foster-country? or make a fortune more promptly on the English
highways?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr.
Lockwood; but I couldn&rsquo;t give my word for any.&nbsp; I
stated before that I didn&rsquo;t know how he gained his money;
neither am I aware of the means he took to raise his mind from
the savage ignorance into which it was sunk: but, with your
leave, I&rsquo;ll proceed in my own fashion, if you think it will
amuse and not weary you.&nbsp; Are you feeling better this
morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s good news.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to
my agreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I
dared to expect.&nbsp; She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton;
and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection.&nbsp; They
were both very attentive to her comfort, certainly.&nbsp; It was
not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles
embracing the thorn.&nbsp; There were no mutual concessions: one
stood erect, and the others yielded: and who can be ill-natured
and bad-tempered when they encounter neither opposition nor
indifference?&nbsp; I observed that Mr. Edgar had a deep-rooted
fear of ruffling her humour.&nbsp; He concealed it from her; but
if ever he heard me answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow
cloudy at some imperious order of hers, he would show his trouble
by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own
account.&nbsp; He many a time spoke sternly to me about my
pertness; and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict
a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed.&nbsp; Not
to grieve a kind master, I learned to be less touchy; and, for
the space of half a year, the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand,
because no fire came near to explode it.&nbsp; Catherine had
seasons of gloom and silence now and then: they were respected
with sympathising silence by her husband, who ascribed them to an
alteration in her constitution, produced by her perilous illness;
as she was never subject to depression of spirits before.&nbsp;
The return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from
him.&nbsp; I believe I may assert that they were really in
possession of deep and growing happiness.</p>
<p>It ended.&nbsp; Well, we <i>must</i> be for ourselves in the
long run; the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than
the domineering; and it ended when circumstances caused each to
feel that the one&rsquo;s interest was not the chief
consideration in the other&rsquo;s thoughts.&nbsp; On a mellow
evening in September, I was coming from the garden with a heavy
basket of apples which I had been gathering.&nbsp; It had got
dusk, and the moon looked over the high wall of the court,
causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous
projecting portions of the building.&nbsp; I set my burden on the
house-steps by the kitchen-door, and lingered to rest, and drew
in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet air; my eyes were on the
moon, and my back to the entrance, when I heard a voice behind me
say,&mdash;&lsquo;Nelly, is that you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was
something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it
sound familiar.&nbsp; I turned about to discover who spoke,
fearfully; for the doors were shut, and I had seen nobody on
approaching the steps.&nbsp; Something stirred in the porch; and,
moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in dark
clothes, with dark face and hair.&nbsp; He leant against the
side, and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open
for himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who can it be?&rsquo; I thought.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mr. Earnshaw?&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp; The voice has no
resemblance to his.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have waited here an hour,&rsquo; he resumed, while I
continued staring; &lsquo;and the whole of that time all round
has been as still as death.&nbsp; I dared not enter.&nbsp; You do
not know me?&nbsp; Look, I&rsquo;m not a stranger!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half
covered with black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes
deep-set and singular.&nbsp; I remembered the eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; I cried, uncertain whether to regard him
as a worldly visitor, and I raised my hands in amazement.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What! you come back?&nbsp; Is it really you?&nbsp; Is
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Heathcliff,&rsquo; he replied, glancing from me up
to the windows, which reflected a score of glittering moons, but
showed no lights from within.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are they at home?
where is she?&nbsp; Nelly, you are not glad! you needn&rsquo;t be
so disturbed.&nbsp; Is she here?&nbsp; Speak!&nbsp; I want to
have one word with her&mdash;your mistress.&nbsp; Go, and say
some person from Gimmerton desires to see her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How will she take it?&rsquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What will she do?&nbsp; The surprise bewilders me&mdash;it
will put her out of her head!&nbsp; And you <i>are</i>
Heathcliff!&nbsp; But altered!&nbsp; Nay, there&rsquo;s no
comprehending it.&nbsp; Have you been for a soldier?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go and carry my message,&rsquo; he interrupted,
impatiently.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in hell till you
do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the
parlour where Mr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade
myself to proceed.&nbsp; At length I resolved on making an excuse
to ask if they would have the candles lighted, and I opened the
door.</p>
<p>They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against
the wall, and displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild
green park, the valley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist
winding nearly to its top (for very soon after you pass the
chapel, as you may have noticed, the sough that runs from the
marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen).&nbsp;
Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our old
house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side.&nbsp;
Both the room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on,
looked wondrously peaceful.&nbsp; I shrank reluctantly from
performing my errand; and was actually going away leaving it
unsaid, after having put my question about the candles, when a
sense of my folly compelled me to return, and mutter, &lsquo;A
person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does he want?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Linton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not question him,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, close the curtains, Nelly,&rsquo; she said;
&lsquo;and bring up tea.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be back again
directly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who
it was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some one mistress does not expect,&rsquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;That Heathcliff&mdash;you recollect him,
sir&mdash;who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! the gipsy&mdash;the ploughboy?&rsquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why did you not say so to
Catherine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush! you must not call him by those names,
master,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;d be sadly grieved
to hear you.&nbsp; She was nearly heartbroken when he ran
off.&nbsp; I guess his return will make a jubilee to
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room
that overlooked the court.&nbsp; He unfastened it, and leant
out.&nbsp; I suppose they were below, for he exclaimed quickly:
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stand there, love!&nbsp; Bring the person in,
if it be anyone particular.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ere long, I heard the
click of the latch, and Catherine flew up-stairs, breathless and
wild; too excited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you
would rather have surmised an awful calamity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Edgar, Edgar!&rsquo; she panted, flinging her arms
round his neck.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Edgar darling!&nbsp;
Heathcliff&rsquo;s come back&mdash;he is!&rsquo;&nbsp; And she
tightened her embrace to a squeeze.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; cried her husband, crossly,
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t strangle me for that!&nbsp; He never struck me
as such a marvellous treasure.&nbsp; There is no need to be
frantic!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you didn&rsquo;t like him,&rsquo; she answered,
repressing a little the intensity of her delight.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now.&nbsp; Shall I
tell him to come up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;into the
parlour?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where else?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable
place for him.&nbsp; Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll
expression&mdash;half angry, half laughing at his
fastidiousness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she added, after a while; &lsquo;I cannot
sit in the kitchen.&nbsp; Set two tables here, Ellen: one for
your master and Miss Isabella, being gentry; the other for
Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders.&nbsp; Will that
please you, dear?&nbsp; Or must I have a fire lighted
elsewhere?&nbsp; If so, give directions.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll run
down and secure my guest.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid the joy is too
great to be real!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>You</i> bid him step up,&rsquo; he said, addressing
me; &lsquo;and, Catherine, try to be glad, without being
absurd.&nbsp; The whole household need not witness the sight of
your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch,
evidently anticipating an invitation to enter.&nbsp; He followed
my guidance without waste of words, and I ushered him into the
presence of the master and mistress, whose flushed cheeks
betrayed signs of warm talking.&nbsp; But the lady&rsquo;s glowed
with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door: she
sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton; and
then she seized Linton&rsquo;s reluctant fingers and crushed them
into his.&nbsp; Now, fully revealed by the fire and candlelight,
I was amazed, more than ever, to behold the transformation of
Heathcliff.&nbsp; He had grown a tall, athletic, well-formed man;
beside whom my master seemed quite slender and youth-like.&nbsp;
His upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been in the
army.&nbsp; His countenance was much older in expression and
decision of feature than Mr. Linton&rsquo;s; it looked
intelligent, and retained no marks of former degradation.&nbsp; A
half-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and
eyes full of black fire, but it was subdued; and his manner was
even dignified: quite divested of roughness, though stern for
grace.&nbsp; My master&rsquo;s surprise equalled or exceeded
mine: he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the
ploughboy, as he had called him.&nbsp; Heathcliff dropped his
slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to
speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sit down, sir,&rsquo; he said, at length.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mrs. Linton, recalling old times, would have me give you a
cordial reception; and, of course, I am gratified when anything
occurs to please her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I also,&rsquo; answered Heathcliff,
&lsquo;especially if it be anything in which I have a part.&nbsp;
I shall stay an hour or two willingly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on
him as if she feared he would vanish were she to remove it.&nbsp;
He did not raise his to her often: a quick glance now and then
sufficed; but it flashed back, each time more confidently, the
undisguised delight he drank from hers.&nbsp; They were too much
absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment.&nbsp; Not
so Mr. Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a feeling that
reached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across the
rug, seized Heathcliff&rsquo;s hands again, and laughed like one
beside herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall think it a dream to-morrow!&rsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall not be able to believe that I have
seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more.&nbsp; And yet,
cruel Heathcliff! you don&rsquo;t deserve this welcome.&nbsp; To
be absent and silent for three years, and never to think of
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A little more than you have thought of me,&rsquo; he
murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;I heard of your marriage, Cathy, not long
since; and, while waiting in the yard below, I meditated this
plan&mdash;just to have one glimpse of your face, a stare of
surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle my
score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution
on myself.&nbsp; Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind;
but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time!&nbsp;
Nay, you&rsquo;ll not drive me off again.&nbsp; You were really
sorry for me, were you?&nbsp; Well, there was cause.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve fought through a bitter life since I last heard your
voice; and you must forgive me, for I struggled only for
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to
come to the table,&rsquo; interrupted Linton, striving to
preserve his ordinary tone, and a due measure of
politeness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk,
wherever he may lodge to-night; and I&rsquo;m thirsty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came,
summoned by the bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I
left the room.&nbsp; The meal hardly endured ten minutes.&nbsp;
Catherine&rsquo;s cup was never filled: she could neither eat nor
drink.&nbsp; Edgar had made a slop in his saucer, and scarcely
swallowed a mouthful.&nbsp; Their guest did not protract his stay
that evening above an hour longer.&nbsp; I asked, as he departed,
if he went to Gimmerton?</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, to Wuthering Heights,&rsquo; he answered:
&lsquo;Mr. Earnshaw invited me, when I called this
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Earnshaw invited <i>him</i>! and <i>he</i> called on Mr.
Earnshaw!&nbsp; I pondered this sentence painfully, after he was
gone.&nbsp; Is he turning out a bit of a hypocrite, and coming
into the country to work mischief under a cloak?&nbsp; I mused: I
had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better
have remained away.</p>
<p>About the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap
by Mrs. Linton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my
bedside, and pulling me by the hair to rouse me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot rest, Ellen,&rsquo; she said, by way of
apology.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I want some living creature to keep me
company in my happiness!&nbsp; Edgar is sulky, because I&rsquo;m
glad of a thing that does not interest him: he refuses to open
his mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he
affirmed I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was
so sick and sleepy.&nbsp; He always contrives to be sick at the
least cross!&nbsp; I gave a few sentences of commendation to
Heathcliff, and he, either for a headache or a pang of envy,
began to cry: so I got up and left him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What use is it praising Heathcliff to him?&rsquo; I
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;As lads they had an aversion to each
other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him
praised: it&rsquo;s human nature.&nbsp; Let Mr. Linton alone
about him, unless you would like an open quarrel between
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But does it not show great weakness?&rsquo; pursued
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not envious: I never feel hurt at the
brightness of Isabella&rsquo;s yellow hair and the whiteness of
her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the family
exhibit for her.&nbsp; Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute
sometimes, you back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish
mother: I call her a darling, and flatter her into a good
temper.&nbsp; It pleases her brother to see us cordial, and that
pleases me.&nbsp; But they are very much alike: they are spoiled
children, and fancy the world was made for their accommodation;
and though I humour both, I think a smart chastisement might
improve them all the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken, Mrs. Linton,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;They humour you: I know what there would be to do
if they did not.&nbsp; You can well afford to indulge their
passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your
desires.&nbsp; You may, however, fall out, at last, over
something of equal consequence to both sides; and then those you
term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then we shall fight to the death,
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t we, Nelly?&rsquo; she returned,
laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;No! I tell you, I have such faith in
Linton&rsquo;s love, that I believe I might kill him, and he
wouldn&rsquo;t wish to retaliate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I advised her to value him the more for his affection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;but he needn&rsquo;t
resort to whining for trifles.&nbsp; It is childish and, instead
of melting into tears because I said that Heathcliff was now
worthy of anyone&rsquo;s regard, and it would honour the first
gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said
it for me, and been delighted from sympathy.&nbsp; He must get
accustomed to him, and he may as well like him: considering how
Heathcliff has reason to object to him, I&rsquo;m sure he behaved
excellently!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you think of his going to Wuthering
Heights?&rsquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is reformed in every
respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering the right hand
of fellowship to his enemies all around!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He explained it,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
wonder as much as you.&nbsp; He said he called to gather
information concerning me from you, supposing you resided there
still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to
questioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been
living; and finally, desired him to walk in.&nbsp; There were
some persons sitting at cards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother
lost some money to him, and, finding him plentifully supplied, he
requested that he would come again in the evening: to which he
consented.&nbsp; Hindley is too reckless to select his
acquaintance prudently: he doesn&rsquo;t trouble himself to
reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he
has basely injured.&nbsp; But Heathcliff affirms his principal
reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a
wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the
Grange, and an attachment to the house where we lived together;
and likewise a hope that I shall have more opportunities of
seeing him there than I could have if he settled in
Gimmerton.&nbsp; He means to offer liberal payment for permission
to lodge at the Heights; and doubtless my brother&rsquo;s
covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms: he was always
greedy; though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with
the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a nice place for a young man to fix his
dwelling in!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you no fear of the
consequences, Mrs. Linton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None for my friend,&rsquo; she replied: &lsquo;his
strong head will keep him from danger; a little for Hindley: but
he can&rsquo;t be made morally worse than he is; and I stand
between him and bodily harm.&nbsp; The event of this evening has
reconciled me to God and humanity!&nbsp; I had risen in angry
rebellion against Providence.&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;ve endured very,
very bitter misery, Nelly!&nbsp; If that creature knew how
bitter, he&rsquo;d be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle
petulance.&nbsp; It was kindness for him which induced me to bear
it alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently felt, he would
have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as
I.&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s over, and I&rsquo;ll take no revenge
on his folly; I can afford to suffer anything hereafter!&nbsp;
Should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek, I&rsquo;d
not only turn the other, but I&rsquo;d ask pardon for provoking
it; and, as a proof, I&rsquo;ll go make my peace with Edgar
instantly.&nbsp; Good-night!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m an angel!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the
success of her fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow:
Mr. Linton had not only abjured his peevishness (though his
spirits seemed still subdued by Catherine&rsquo;s exuberance of
vivacity), but he ventured no objection to her taking Isabella
with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and she rewarded
him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as
made the house a paradise for several days; both master and
servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine.</p>
<p>Heathcliff&mdash;Mr. Heathcliff I should say in
future&mdash;used the liberty of visiting at Thrushcross Grange
cautiously, at first: he seemed estimating how far its owner
would bear his intrusion.&nbsp; Catherine, also, deemed it
judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving
him; and he gradually established his right to be expected.&nbsp;
He retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was
remarkable; and that served to repress all startling
demonstrations of feeling.&nbsp; My master&rsquo;s uneasiness
experienced a lull, and further circumstances diverted it into
another channel for a space.</p>
<p>His new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated
misfortune of Isabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible
attraction towards the tolerated guest.&nbsp; She was at that
time a charming young lady of eighteen; infantile in manners,
though possessed of keen wit, keen feelings, and a keen temper,
too, if irritated.&nbsp; Her brother, who loved her tenderly, was
appalled at this fantastic preference.&nbsp; Leaving aside the
degradation of an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible
fact that his property, in default of heirs male, might pass into
such a one&rsquo;s power, he had sense to comprehend
Heathcliff&rsquo;s disposition: to know that, though his exterior
was altered, his mind was unchangeable and unchanged.&nbsp; And
he dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank forebodingly
from the idea of committing Isabella to its keeping.&nbsp; He
would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her
attachment rose unsolicited, and was bestowed where it awakened
no reciprocation of sentiment; for the minute he discovered its
existence he laid the blame on Heathcliff&rsquo;s deliberate
designing.</p>
<p>We had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton
fretted and pined over something.&nbsp; She grew cross and
wearisome; snapping at and teasing Catherine continually, at the
imminent risk of exhausting her limited patience.&nbsp; We
excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of ill-health: she
was dwindling and fading before our eyes.&nbsp; But one day, when
she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast,
complaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that
the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and
Edgar neglected her; that she had caught a cold with the doors
being left open, and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to
vex her, with a hundred yet more frivolous accusations, Mrs.
Linton peremptorily insisted that she should get to bed; and,
having scolded her heartily, threatened to send for the
doctor.&nbsp; Mention of Kenneth caused her to exclaim,
instantly, that her health was perfect, and it was only
Catherine&rsquo;s harshness which made her unhappy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you say I am harsh, you naughty
fondling?&rsquo; cried the mistress, amazed at the unreasonable
assertion.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are surely losing your reason.&nbsp;
When have I been harsh, tell me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yesterday,&rsquo; sobbed Isabella, &lsquo;and
now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yesterday!&rsquo; said her sister-in-law.&nbsp;
&lsquo;On what occasion?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where
I pleased, while you sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that&rsquo;s your notion of harshness?&rsquo; said
Catherine, laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was no hint that your
company was superfluous?&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t care whether you
kept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliff&rsquo;s talk
would have nothing entertaining for your ears.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; wept the young lady; &lsquo;you wished
me away, because you knew I liked to be there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she sane?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll repeat our conversation, word for
word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it could have had for
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the conversation,&rsquo; she
answered: &lsquo;I wanted to be with&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to
complete the sentence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With him: and I won&rsquo;t be always sent off!&rsquo;
she continued, kindling up.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are a dog in the
manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but
yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are an impertinent little monkey!&rsquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Linton, in surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll not believe
this idiotcy!&nbsp; It is impossible that you can covet the
admiration of Heathcliff&mdash;that you consider him an agreeable
person!&nbsp; I hope I have misunderstood you,
Isabella?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you have not,&rsquo; said the infatuated
girl.&nbsp; &lsquo;I love him more than ever you loved Edgar, and
he might love me, if you would let him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be you for a kingdom, then!&rsquo;
Catherine declared, emphatically: and she seemed to speak
sincerely.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nelly, help me to convince her of her
madness.&nbsp; Tell her what Heathcliff is: an unreclaimed
creature, without refinement, without cultivation; an arid
wilderness of furze and whinstone.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d as soon put
that little canary into the park on a winter&rsquo;s day, as
recommend you to bestow your heart on him!&nbsp; It is deplorable
ignorance of his character, child, and nothing else, which makes
that dream enter your head.&nbsp; Pray, don&rsquo;t imagine that
he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern
exterior!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not a rough diamond&mdash;a
pearl-containing oyster of a rustic: he&rsquo;s a fierce,
pitiless, wolfish man.&nbsp; I never say to him, &ldquo;Let this
or that enemy alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to
harm them;&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;Let them alone, because <i>I</i>
should hate them to be wronged:&rdquo; and he&rsquo;d crush you
like a sparrow&rsquo;s egg, Isabella, if he found you a
troublesome charge.&nbsp; I know he couldn&rsquo;t love a Linton;
and yet he&rsquo;d be quite capable of marrying your fortune and
expectations: avarice is growing with him a besetting sin.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s my picture: and I&rsquo;m his friend&mdash;so much
so, that had he thought seriously to catch you, I should,
perhaps, have held my tongue, and let you fall into his
trap.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame! for shame!&rsquo; she repeated,
angrily.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are worse than twenty foes, you
poisonous friend!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you won&rsquo;t believe me, then?&rsquo; said
Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;You think I speak from wicked
selfishness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m certain you do,&rsquo; retorted Isabella;
&lsquo;and I shudder at you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good!&rsquo; cried the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;Try for
yourself, if that be your spirit: I have done, and yield the
argument to your saucy insolence.&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I must suffer for her egotism!&rsquo; she sobbed,
as Mrs. Linton left the room.&nbsp; &lsquo;All, all is against
me: she has blighted my single consolation.&nbsp; But she uttered
falsehoods, didn&rsquo;t she?&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff is not a
fiend: he has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he
remember her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Banish him from your thoughts, Miss,&rsquo; I
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a bird of bad omen: no mate for
you.&nbsp; Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can&rsquo;t
contradict her.&nbsp; She is better acquainted with his heart
than I, or any one besides; and she never would represent him as
worse than he is.&nbsp; Honest people don&rsquo;t hide their
deeds.&nbsp; How has he been living? how has he got rich? why is
he staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man whom he
abhors?&nbsp; They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he
came.&nbsp; They sit up all night together continually, and
Hindley has been borrowing money on his land, and does nothing
but play and drink: I heard only a week ago&mdash;it was Joseph
who told me&mdash;I met him at Gimmerton: &ldquo;Nelly,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;s hae a crowner&rsquo;s &lsquo;quest enow,
at ahr folks&rsquo;.&nbsp; One on &rsquo;em &rsquo;s a&rsquo;most
getten his finger cut off wi&rsquo; hauding t&rsquo; other
fro&rsquo; stickin&rsquo; hisseln loike a cawlf.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s maister, yeah knaw, &rsquo;at &rsquo;s soa up
o&rsquo; going tuh t&rsquo; grand &rsquo;sizes.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
noan feared o&rsquo; t&rsquo; bench o&rsquo; judges, norther
Paul, nur Peter, nur John, nur Matthew, nor noan on &rsquo;em,
not he!&nbsp; He fair likes&mdash;he langs to set his brazened
face agean &rsquo;em!&nbsp; And yon bonny lad Heathcliff, yah
mind, he&rsquo;s a rare &rsquo;un.&nbsp; He can girn a laugh as
well &rsquo;s onybody at a raight divil&rsquo;s jest.&nbsp; Does
he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us, when he goes to
t&rsquo; Grange?&nbsp; This is t&rsquo; way on &rsquo;t:&mdash;up
at sun-down: dice, brandy, cloised shutters, und
can&rsquo;le-light till next day at noon: then, t&rsquo;fooil
gangs banning und raving to his cham&rsquo;er, makking dacent
fowks dig thur fingers i&rsquo; thur lugs fur varry shame;
un&rsquo; the knave, why he can caint his brass, un&rsquo; ate,
un&rsquo; sleep, un&rsquo; off to his neighbour&rsquo;s to gossip
wi&rsquo; t&rsquo; wife.&nbsp; I&rsquo; course, he tells Dame
Catherine how her fathur&rsquo;s goold runs into his pocket, and
her fathur&rsquo;s son gallops down t&rsquo; broad road, while he
flees afore to oppen t&rsquo; pikes!&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, Miss
Linton, Joseph is an old rascal, but no liar; and, if his account
of Heathcliff&rsquo;s conduct be true, you would never think of
desiring such a husband, would you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!&rsquo; she
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not listen to your
slanders.&nbsp; What malevolence you must have to wish to
convince me that there is no happiness in the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself,
or persevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she had
little time to reflect.&nbsp; The day after, there was a
justice-meeting at the next town; my master was obliged to
attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his absence, called rather
earlier than usual.&nbsp; Catherine and Isabella were sitting in
the library, on hostile terms, but silent: the latter alarmed at
her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she had made of her
secret feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on
mature consideration, really offended with her companion; and, if
she laughed again at her pertness, inclined to make it no
laughing matter to her.&nbsp; She did laugh as she saw Heathcliff
pass the window.&nbsp; I was sweeping the hearth, and I noticed a
mischievous smile on her lips.&nbsp; Isabella, absorbed in her
meditations, or a book, remained till the door opened; and it was
too late to attempt an escape, which she would gladly have done
had it been practicable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come in, that&rsquo;s right!&rsquo; exclaimed the
mistress, gaily, pulling a chair to the fire.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here
are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the ice between
them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose.&nbsp;
Heathcliff, I&rsquo;m proud to show you, at last, somebody that
dotes on you more than myself.&nbsp; I expect you to feel
flattered.&nbsp; Nay, it&rsquo;s not Nelly; don&rsquo;t look at
her!&nbsp; My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart by
mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty.&nbsp; It
lies in your own power to be Edgar&rsquo;s brother!&nbsp; No, no,
Isabella, you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t run off,&rsquo; she continued,
arresting, with feigned playfulness, the confounded girl, who had
risen indignantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;We were quarrelling like cats
about you, Heathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations
of devotion and admiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if
I would but have the manners to stand aside, my rival, as she
will have herself to be, would shoot a shaft into your soul that
would fix you for ever, and send my image into eternal
oblivion!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Catherine!&rsquo; said Isabella, calling up her
dignity, and disdaining to struggle from the tight grasp that
held her, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d thank you to adhere to the truth and
not slander me, even in joke!&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff, be kind
enough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that
you and I are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is
painful to me beyond expression.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked
thoroughly indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning
him, she turned and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to
her tormentor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By no means!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Linton in answer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t be named a dog in the manger again.&nbsp;
You <i>shall</i> stay: now then!&nbsp; Heathcliff, why
don&rsquo;t you evince satisfaction at my pleasant news?&nbsp;
Isabella swears that the love Edgar has for me is nothing to that
she entertains for you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure she made some speech
of the kind; did she not, Ellen?&nbsp; And she has fasted ever
since the day before yesterday&rsquo;s walk, from sorrow and rage
that I despatched her out of your society under the idea of its
being unacceptable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you belie her,&rsquo; said Heathcliff, twisting
his chair to face them.&nbsp; &lsquo;She wishes to be out of my
society now, at any rate!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do
at a strange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for
instance, which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the
aversion it raises.&nbsp; The poor thing couldn&rsquo;t bear
that; she grew white and red in rapid succession, and, while
tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength of her small fingers
to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and perceiving that as
fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down,
and she could not remove the whole together, she began to make
use of her nails; and their sharpness presently ornamented the
detainer&rsquo;s with crescents of red.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a tigress!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Linton,
setting her free, and shaking her hand with pain.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Begone, for God&rsquo;s sake, and hide your vixen
face!&nbsp; How foolish to reveal those talons to him.&nbsp;
Can&rsquo;t you fancy the conclusions he&rsquo;ll draw?&nbsp;
Look, Heathcliff! they are instruments that will do
execution&mdash;you must beware of your eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d wrench them off her fingers, if they ever
menaced me,&rsquo; he answered, brutally, when the door had
closed after her.&nbsp; &lsquo;But what did you mean by teasing
the creature in that manner, Cathy?&nbsp; You were not speaking
the truth, were you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I assure you I was,&rsquo; she returned.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She has been dying for your sake several weeks, and raving
about you this morning, and pouring forth a deluge of abuse,
because I represented your failings in a plain light, for the
purpose of mitigating her adoration.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t notice
it further: I wished to punish her sauciness, that&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; I like her too well, my dear Heathcliff, to let you
absolutely seize and devour her up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I like her too ill to attempt it,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;except in a very ghoulish fashion.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d hear
of odd things if I lived alone with that mawkish, waxen face: the
most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the
rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day or two: they
detestably resemble Linton&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Delectably!&rsquo; observed Catherine.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They are dove&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;angel&rsquo;s!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s her brother&rsquo;s heir, is she
not?&rsquo; he asked, after a brief silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be sorry to think so,&rsquo; returned his
companion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Half a dozen nephews shall erase her
title, please heaven!&nbsp; Abstract your mind from the subject
at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour&rsquo;s
goods; remember <i>this</i> neighbour&rsquo;s goods are
mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If they were <i>mine</i>, they would be none the less
that,&rsquo; said Heathcliff; &lsquo;but though Isabella Linton
may be silly, she is scarcely mad; and, in short, we&rsquo;ll
dismiss the matter, as you advise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine,
probably, from her thoughts.&nbsp; The other, I felt certain,
recalled it often in the course of the evening.&nbsp; I saw him
smile to himself&mdash;grin rather&mdash;and lapse into ominous
musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from the
apartment.</p>
<p>I determined to watch his movements.&nbsp; My heart invariably
cleaved to the master&rsquo;s, in preference to Catherine&rsquo;s
side: with reason I imagined, for he was kind, and trustful, and
honourable; and she&mdash;she could not be called
<i>opposite</i>, yet she seemed to allow herself such wide
latitude, that I had little faith in her principles, and still
less sympathy for her feelings.&nbsp; I wanted something to
happen which might have the effect of freeing both Wuthering
Heights and the Grange of Mr. Heathcliff quietly; leaving us as
we had been prior to his advent.&nbsp; His visits were a
continual nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my master
also.&nbsp; His abode at the Heights was an oppression past
explaining.&nbsp; I felt that God had forsaken the stray sheep
there to its own wicked wanderings, and an evil beast prowled
between it and the fold, waiting his time to spring and
destroy.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>Sometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude,
I&rsquo;ve got up in a sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go
see how all was at the farm.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve persuaded my
conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people talked
regarding his ways; and then I&rsquo;ve recollected his confirmed
bad habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched from
re-entering the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be
taken at my word.</p>
<p>One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a
journey to Gimmerton.&nbsp; It was about the period that my
narrative has reached: a bright frosty afternoon; the ground
bare, and the road hard and dry.&nbsp; I came to a stone where
the highway branches off on to the moor at your left hand; a
rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north side,
on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G.&nbsp; It serves as
a guide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village.&nbsp; The
sun shone yellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I
cannot say why, but all at once a gush of child&rsquo;s
sensations flowed into my heart.&nbsp; Hindley and I held it a
favourite spot twenty years before.&nbsp; I gazed long at the
weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole near the
bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were fond
of storing there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as
reality, it appeared that I beheld my early playmate seated on
the withered turf: his dark, square head bent forward, and his
little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Poor Hindley!&rsquo; I exclaimed, involuntarily.&nbsp; I
started: my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that
the child lifted its face and stared straight into mine!&nbsp; It
vanished in a twinkling; but immediately I felt an irresistible
yearning to be at the Heights.&nbsp; Superstition urged me to
comply with this impulse: supposing he should be dead!&nbsp; I
thought&mdash;or should die soon!&mdash;supposing it were a sign
of death!&nbsp; The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I
grew; and on catching sight of it I trembled in every limb.&nbsp;
The apparition had outstripped me: it stood looking through the
gate.&nbsp; That was my first idea on observing an elf-locked,
brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the
bars.&nbsp; Further reflection suggested this must be Hareton,
<i>my</i> Hareton, not altered greatly since I left him, ten
months since.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God bless thee, darling!&rsquo; I cried, forgetting
instantaneously my foolish fears.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hareton,
it&rsquo;s Nelly!&nbsp; Nelly, thy nurse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He retreated out of arm&rsquo;s length, and picked up a large
flint.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am come to see thy father, Hareton,&rsquo; I added,
guessing from the action that Nelly, if she lived in his memory
at all, was not recognised as one with me.</p>
<p>He raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing
speech, but could not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet;
and then ensued, from the stammering lips of the little fellow, a
string of curses, which, whether he comprehended them or not,
were delivered with practised emphasis, and distorted his baby
features into a shocking expression of malignity.&nbsp; You may
be certain this grieved more than angered me.&nbsp; Fit to cry, I
took an orange from my pocket, and offered it to propitiate
him.&nbsp; He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as if
he fancied I only intended to tempt and disappoint him.&nbsp; I
showed another, keeping it out of his reach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?&rsquo; I
inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;The curate?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damn the curate, and thee!&nbsp; Gie me that,&rsquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have
it,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s your
master?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Devil daddy,&rsquo; was his answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what do you learn from daddy?&rsquo; I
continued.</p>
<p>He jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
does he teach you?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Naught,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but to keep out of his
gait.&nbsp; Daddy cannot bide me, because I swear at
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?&rsquo;
I observed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay&mdash;nay,&rsquo; he drawled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heathcliff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay!&rsquo; he answered again.</p>
<p>Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only
gather the sentences&mdash;&lsquo;I known&rsquo;t: he pays dad
back what he gies to me&mdash;he curses daddy for cursing
me.&nbsp; He says I mun do as I will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the curate does not teach you to read and write,
then?&rsquo; I pursued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I was told the curate should have his&mdash;teeth
dashed down his&mdash;throat, if he stepped over the
threshold&mdash;Heathcliff had promised that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father
that a woman called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by
the garden gate.&nbsp; He went up the walk, and entered the
house; but, instead of Hindley, Heathcliff appeared on the
door-stones; and I turned directly and ran down the road as hard
as ever I could race, making no halt till I gained the
guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a
goblin.&nbsp; This is not much connected with Miss
Isabella&rsquo;s affair: except that it urged me to resolve
further on mounting vigilant guard, and doing my utmost to check
the spread of such bad influence at the Grange: even though I
should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s
pleasure.</p>
<p>The next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be
feeding some pigeons in the court.&nbsp; She had never spoken a
word to her sister-in-law for three days; but she had likewise
dropped her fretful complaining, and we found it a great
comfort.&nbsp; Heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single
unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew.&nbsp; Now, as soon
as he beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping
survey of the house-front.&nbsp; I was standing by the
kitchen-window, but I drew out of sight.&nbsp; He then stepped
across the pavement to her, and said something: she seemed
embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to prevent it, he laid
his hand on her arm.&nbsp; She averted her face: he apparently
put some question which she had no mind to answer.&nbsp; There
was another rapid glance at the house, and supposing himself
unseen, the scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Judas!&nbsp; Traitor!&rsquo; I ejaculated.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are a hypocrite, too, are you?&nbsp; A deliberate
deceiver.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is, Nelly?&rsquo; said Catherine&rsquo;s voice at
my elbow: I had been over-intent on watching the pair outside to
mark her entrance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your worthless friend!&rsquo; I answered, warmly:
&lsquo;the sneaking rascal yonder.&nbsp; Ah, he has caught a
glimpse of us&mdash;he is coming in!&nbsp; I wonder will he have
the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to Miss,
when he told you he hated her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the
garden; and a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t withhold giving some loose to my indignation; but
Catherine angrily insisted on silence, and threatened to order me
out of the kitchen, if I dared to be so presumptuous as to put in
my insolent tongue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To hear you, people might think you were the
mistress!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;You want setting down in
your right place!&nbsp; Heathcliff, what are you about, raising
this stir?&nbsp; I said you must let Isabella alone!&mdash;I beg
you will, unless you are tired of being received here, and wish
Linton to draw the bolts against you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God forbid that he should try!&rsquo; answered the
black villain.&nbsp; I detested him just then.&nbsp; &lsquo;God
keep him meek and patient!&nbsp; Every day I grow madder after
sending him to heaven!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said Catherine, shutting the inner
door!&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t vex me.&nbsp; Why have you
disregarded my request?&nbsp; Did she come across you on
purpose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it to you?&rsquo; he growled.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have a right to kiss her, if she chooses; and you have no right
to object.&nbsp; I am not <i>your</i> husband: <i>you</i>
needn&rsquo;t be jealous of me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not jealous of you,&rsquo; replied the
mistress; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m jealous for you.&nbsp; Clear your
face: you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t scowl at me!&nbsp; If you like
Isabella, you shall marry her.&nbsp; But do you like her?&nbsp;
Tell the truth, Heathcliff!&nbsp; There, you won&rsquo;t
answer.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m certain you don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying
that man?&rsquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Linton should approve,&rsquo; returned my lady,
decisively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He might spare himself the trouble,&rsquo; said
Heathcliff: &lsquo;I could do as well without his
approbation.&nbsp; And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind to
speak a few words now, while we are at it.&nbsp; I want you to be
aware that I <i>know</i> you have treated me
infernally&mdash;infernally!&nbsp; Do you hear?&nbsp; And if you
flatter yourself that I don&rsquo;t perceive it, you are a fool;
and if you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an
idiot: and if you fancy I&rsquo;ll suffer unrevenged, I&rsquo;ll
convince you of the contrary, in a very little while!&nbsp;
Meantime, thank you for telling me your sister-in-law&rsquo;s
secret: I swear I&rsquo;ll make the most of it.&nbsp; And stand
you aside!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What new phase of his character is this?&rsquo;
exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in amazement.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
treated you infernally&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll take your
revenge!&nbsp; How will you take it, ungrateful brute?&nbsp; How
have I treated you infernally?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I seek no revenge on you,&rsquo; replied Heathcliff,
less vehemently.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not the plan.&nbsp;
The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don&rsquo;t turn
against him; they crush those beneath them.&nbsp; You are welcome
to torture me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse
myself a little in the same style, and refrain from insult as
much as you are able.&nbsp; Having levelled my palace,
don&rsquo;t erect a hovel and complacently admire your own
charity in giving me that for a home.&nbsp; If I imagined you
really wished me to marry Isabel, I&rsquo;d cut my
throat!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, the evil is that I am <i>not</i> jealous, is
it?&rsquo; cried Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t
repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering Satan a lost
soul.&nbsp; Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting
misery.&nbsp; You prove it.&nbsp; Edgar is restored from the
ill-temper he gave way to at your coming; I begin to be secure
and tranquil; and you, restless to know us at peace, appear
resolved on exciting a quarrel.&nbsp; Quarrel with Edgar, if you
please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you&rsquo;ll hit on
exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The conversation ceased.&nbsp; Mrs. Linton sat down by the
fire, flushed and gloomy.&nbsp; The spirit which served her was
growing intractable: she could neither lay nor control it.&nbsp;
He stood on the hearth with folded arms, brooding on his evil
thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek the master,
who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ellen,&rsquo; said he, when I entered, &lsquo;have you
seen your mistress?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; she&rsquo;s in the kitchen, sir,&rsquo; I
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s sadly put out by Mr.
Heathcliff&rsquo;s behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it&rsquo;s
time to arrange his visits on another footing.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s harm in being too soft, and now it&rsquo;s come to
this&mdash;.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I related the scene in the court,
and, as near as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute.&nbsp; I
fancied it could not be very prejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless
she made it so afterwards, by assuming the defensive for her
guest.&nbsp; Edgar Linton had difficulty in hearing me to the
close.&nbsp; His first words revealed that he did not clear his
wife of blame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is insufferable!&rsquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is disgraceful that she should own him for a friend,
and force his company on me!&nbsp; Call me two men out of the
hall, Ellen.&nbsp; Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with
the low ruffian&mdash;I have humoured her enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage,
went, followed by me, to the kitchen.&nbsp; Its occupants had
recommenced their angry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was
scolding with renewed vigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window,
and hung his head, somewhat cowed by her violent rating
apparently.&nbsp; He saw the master first, and made a hasty
motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed, abruptly, on
discovering the reason of his intimation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is this?&rsquo; said Linton, addressing her;
&lsquo;what notion of propriety must you have to remain here,
after the language which has been held to you by that
blackguard?&nbsp; I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you
think nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and,
perhaps, imagine I can get used to it too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?&rsquo;
asked the mistress, in a tone particularly calculated to provoke
her husband, implying both carelessness and contempt of his
irritation.&nbsp; Heathcliff, who had raised his eyes at the
former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on purpose,
it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton&rsquo;s attention to him.&nbsp; He
succeeded; but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high
flights of passion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been so far forbearing with you, sir,&rsquo;
he said quietly; &lsquo;not that I was ignorant of your
miserable, degraded character, but I felt you were only partly
responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up your
acquaintance, I acquiesced&mdash;foolishly.&nbsp; Your presence
is a moral poison that would contaminate the most virtuous: for
that cause, and to prevent worse consequences, I shall deny you
hereafter admission into this house, and give notice now that I
require your instant departure.&nbsp; Three minutes&rsquo; delay
will render it involuntary and ignominious.'</p>
<p>Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with
an eye full of derision.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is in danger of splitting its skull
against my knuckles.&nbsp; By God!&nbsp; Mr. Linton, I&rsquo;m
mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!&rsquo;</p>
<p>My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch
the men: he had no intention of hazarding a personal
encounter.&nbsp; I obeyed the hint; but Mrs. Linton, suspecting
something, followed; and when I attempted to call them, she
pulled me back, slammed the door to, and locked it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fair means!&rsquo; she said, in answer to her
husband&rsquo;s look of angry surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you have
not courage to attack him, make an apology, or allow yourself to
be beaten.&nbsp; It will correct you of feigning more valour than
you possess.&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;ll swallow the key before you
shall get it!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m delightfully rewarded for my
kindness to each!&nbsp; After constant indulgence of one&rsquo;s
weak nature, and the other&rsquo;s bad one, I earn for thanks two
samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity!&nbsp; Edgar, I
was defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you
sick, for daring to think an evil thought of me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that
effect on the master.&nbsp; He tried to wrest the key from
Catherine&rsquo;s grasp, and for safety she flung it into the
hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr. Edgar was taken with a
nervous trembling, and his countenance grew deadly pale.&nbsp;
For his life he could not avert that excess of emotion: mingled
anguish and humiliation overcame him completely.&nbsp; He leant
on the back of a chair, and covered his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, heavens!&nbsp; In old days this would win you
knighthood!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are
vanquished! we are vanquished!&nbsp; Heathcliff would as soon
lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a
colony of mice.&nbsp; Cheer up! you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be
hurt!&nbsp; Your type is not a lamb, it&rsquo;s a sucking
leveret.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward,
Cathy!&rsquo; said her friend.&nbsp; &lsquo;I compliment you on
your taste.&nbsp; And that is the slavering, shivering thing you
preferred to me!&nbsp; I would not strike him with my fist, but
I&rsquo;d kick him with my foot, and experience considerable
satisfaction.&nbsp; Is he weeping, or is he going to faint for
fear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton
rested a push.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d better have kept his distance: my
master quickly sprang erect, and struck him full on the throat a
blow that would have levelled a slighter man.&nbsp; It took his
breath for a minute; and while he choked, Mr. Linton walked out
by the back door into the yard, and from thence to the front
entrance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There! you&rsquo;ve done with coming here,&rsquo; cried
Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get away, now; he&rsquo;ll return with a
brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants.&nbsp; If he did
overhear us, of course he&rsquo;d never forgive you.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve played me an ill turn, Heathcliff!&nbsp; But
go&mdash;make haste!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather see Edgar at bay than
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you suppose I&rsquo;m going with that blow burning
in my gullet?&rsquo; he thundered.&nbsp; &lsquo;By hell,
no!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut
before I cross the threshold!&nbsp; If I don&rsquo;t floor him
now, I shall murder him some time; so, as you value his
existence, let me get at him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not coming,&rsquo; I interposed, framing a bit of
a lie.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the coachman and the two
gardeners; you&rsquo;ll surely not wait to be thrust into the
road by them!&nbsp; Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very
likely, be watching from the parlour-windows to see that they
fulfil his orders.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The gardeners and coachman were there: but Linton was with
them.&nbsp; They had already entered the court.&nbsp; Heathcliff,
on the second thoughts, resolved to avoid a struggle against
three underlings: he seized the poker, smashed the lock from the
inner door, and made his escape as they tramped in.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her
up-stairs.&nbsp; She did not know my share in contributing to the
disturbance, and I was anxious to keep her in ignorance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m nearly distracted, Nelly!&rsquo; she
exclaimed, throwing herself on the sofa.&nbsp; &lsquo;A thousand
smiths&rsquo; hammers are beating in my head!&nbsp; Tell Isabella
to shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should she or any
one else aggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild.&nbsp;
And, Nelly, say to Edgar, if you see him again to-night, that
I&rsquo;m in danger of being seriously ill.&nbsp; I wish it may
prove true.&nbsp; He has startled and distressed me
shockingly!&nbsp; I want to frighten him.&nbsp; Besides, he might
come and begin a string of abuse or complainings; I&rsquo;m
certain I should recriminate, and God knows where we should
end!&nbsp; Will you do so, my good Nelly?&nbsp; You are aware
that I am no way blamable in this matter.&nbsp; What possessed
him to turn listener?&nbsp; Heathcliff&rsquo;s talk was
outrageous, after you left us; but I could soon have diverted him
from Isabella, and the rest meant nothing.&nbsp; Now all is
dashed wrong; by the fool&rsquo;s craving to hear evil of self,
that haunts some people like a demon!&nbsp; Had Edgar never
gathered our conversation, he would never have been the worse for
it.&nbsp; Really, when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone
of displeasure after I had scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse
for him, I did not care hardly what they did to each other;
especially as I felt that, however the scene closed, we should
all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long!&nbsp; Well, if I
cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend&mdash;if Edgar will be mean
and jealous, I&rsquo;ll try to break their hearts by breaking my
own.&nbsp; That will be a prompt way of finishing all, when I am
pushed to extremity!&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a deed to be reserved
for a forlorn hope; I&rsquo;d not take Linton by surprise with
it.&nbsp; To this point he has been discreet in dreading to
provoke me; you must represent the peril of quitting that policy,
and remind him of my passionate temper, verging, when kindled, on
frenzy.&nbsp; I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that
countenance, and look rather more anxious about me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no
doubt, rather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect
sincerity; but I believed a person who could plan the turning of
her fits of passion to account, beforehand, might, by exerting
her will, manage to control herself tolerably, even while under
their influence; and I did not wish to &lsquo;frighten&rsquo; her
husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for the purpose
of serving her selfishness.&nbsp; Therefore I said nothing when I
met the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty
of turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel
together.&nbsp; He began to speak first.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Remain where you are, Catherine,&rsquo; he said;
without any anger in his voice, but with much sorrowful
despondency.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall not stay.&nbsp; I am neither
come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn
whether, after this evening&rsquo;s events, you intend to
continue your intimacy with&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, for mercy&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; interrupted the
mistress, stamping her foot, &lsquo;for mercy&rsquo;s sake, let
us hear no more of it now!&nbsp; Your cold blood cannot be worked
into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but mine are
boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them
dance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To get rid of me, answer my question,&rsquo; persevered
Mr. Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must answer it; and that violence
does not alarm me.&nbsp; I have found that you can be as stoical
as anyone, when you please.&nbsp; Will you give up Heathcliff
hereafter, or will you give up me?&nbsp; It is impossible for you
to be <i>my</i> friend and <i>his</i> at the same time; and I
absolutely <i>require</i> to know which you choose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I require to be let alone!&rsquo; exclaimed Catherine,
furiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;I demand it!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see I
can scarcely stand?&nbsp; Edgar, you&mdash;you leave
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered
leisurely.&nbsp; It was enough to try the temper of a saint, such
senseless, wicked rages!&nbsp; There she lay dashing her head
against the arm of the sofa, and grinding her teeth, so that you
might fancy she would crash them to splinters!&nbsp; Mr. Linton
stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear.&nbsp; He
told me to fetch some water.&nbsp; She had no breath for
speaking.&nbsp; I brought a glass full; and as she would not
drink, I sprinkled it on her face.&nbsp; In a few seconds she
stretched herself out stiff, and turned up her eyes, while her
cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the aspect of
death.&nbsp; Linton looked terrified.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is nothing in the world the matter,&rsquo; I
whispered.&nbsp; I did not want him to yield, though I could not
help being afraid in my heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has blood on her lips!&rsquo; he said,
shuddering.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind!&rsquo; I answered, tartly.&nbsp; And I told
him how she had resolved, previous to his coming, on exhibiting a
fit of frenzy.&nbsp; I incautiously gave the account aloud, and
she heard me; for she started up&mdash;her hair flying over her
shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck and arms
standing out preternaturally.&nbsp; I made up my mind for broken
bones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant,
and then rushed from the room.&nbsp; The master directed me to
follow; I did, to her chamber-door: she hindered me from going
further by securing it against me.</p>
<p>As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I
went to ask whether she would have some carried up.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No!&rsquo; she replied, peremptorily.&nbsp; The same
question was repeated at dinner and tea; and again on the morrow
after, and received the same answer.&nbsp; Mr. Linton, on his
part, spent his time in the library, and did not inquire
concerning his wife&rsquo;s occupations.&nbsp; Isabella and he
had had an hour&rsquo;s interview, during which he tried to
elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for
Heathcliff&rsquo;s advances: but he could make nothing of her
evasive replies, and was obliged to close the examination
unsatisfactorily; adding, however, a solemn warning, that if she
were so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor, it would
dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>While Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always
silent, and almost always in tears; and her brother shut himself
up among books that he never opened&mdash;wearying, I guessed,
with a continual vague expectation that Catherine, repenting her
conduct, would come of her own accord to ask pardon, and seek a
reconciliation&mdash;and <i>she</i> fasted pertinaciously, under
the idea, probably, that at every meal Edgar was ready to choke
for her absence, and pride alone held him from running to cast
himself at her feet; I went about my household duties, convinced
that the Grange had but one sensible soul in its walls, and that
lodged in my body.&nbsp; I wasted no condolences on Miss, nor any
expostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay much attention to
the sighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady&rsquo;s
name, since he might not hear her voice.&nbsp; I determined they
should come about as they pleased for me; and though it was a
tiresomely slow process, I began to rejoice at length in a faint
dawn of its progress: as I thought at first.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having
finished the water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed
supply, and a basin of gruel, for she believed she was
dying.&nbsp; That I set down as a speech meant for Edgar&rsquo;s
ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it to myself and
brought her some tea and dry toast.&nbsp; She ate and drank
eagerly, and sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands
and groaning.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, I will die,&rsquo; she exclaimed,
&lsquo;since no one cares anything about me.&nbsp; I wish I had
not taken that.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then a good while after I heard her
murmur, &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll not die&mdash;he&rsquo;d be
glad&mdash;he does not love me at all&mdash;he would never miss
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you want anything, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; I inquired,
still preserving my external composure, in spite of her ghastly
countenance and strange, exaggerated manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is that apathetic being doing?&rsquo; she
demanded, pushing the thick entangled locks from her wasted
face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Has he fallen into a lethargy, or is he
dead?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither,&rsquo; replied I; &lsquo;if you mean Mr.
Linton.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s tolerably well, I think, though his
studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is continually
among his books, since he has no other society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition,
but I could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of
her disorder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Among his books!&rsquo; she cried, confounded.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And I dying!&nbsp; I on the brink of the grave!&nbsp; My
God! does he know how I&rsquo;m altered?&rsquo; continued she,
staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the
opposite wall.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is that Catherine Linton?&nbsp;&nbsp;
He imagines me in a pet&mdash;in play, perhaps.&nbsp; Cannot you
inform him that it is frightful earnest?&nbsp; Nelly, if it be
not too late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I&rsquo;ll choose
between these two: either to starve at once&mdash;that would be
no punishment unless he had a heart&mdash;or to recover, and
leave the country.&nbsp; Are you speaking the truth about him
now?&nbsp; Take care.&nbsp; Is he actually so utterly indifferent
for my life?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;the master
has no idea of your being deranged; and of course he does not
fear that you will let yourself die of hunger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think not?&nbsp; Cannot you tell him I will?&rsquo;
she returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;Persuade him! speak of your own mind:
say you are certain I will!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you forget, Mrs. Linton,&rsquo; I suggested,
&lsquo;that you have eaten some food with a relish this evening,
and to-morrow you will perceive its good effects.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I were only sure it would kill him,&rsquo; she
interrupted, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d kill myself directly!&nbsp; These
three awful nights I&rsquo;ve never closed my lids&mdash;and oh,
I&rsquo;ve been tormented!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been haunted,
Nelly!&nbsp; But I begin to fancy you don&rsquo;t like me.&nbsp;
How strange!&nbsp; I thought, though everybody hated and despised
each other, they could not avoid loving me.&nbsp; And they have
all turned to enemies in a few hours: they have, I&rsquo;m
positive; the people here.&nbsp; How dreary to meet death,
surrounded by their cold faces!&nbsp; Isabella, terrified and
repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be so dreadful to
watch Catherine go.&nbsp; And Edgar standing solemnly by to see
it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring
peace to his house, and going back to his <i>books</i>!&nbsp;
What in the name of all that feels has he to do with
<i>books</i>, when I am dying?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of
Mr. Linton&rsquo;s philosophical resignation.&nbsp; Tossing
about, she increased her feverish bewilderment to madness, and
tore the pillow with her teeth; then raising herself up all
burning, desired that I would open the window.&nbsp; We were in
the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the north-east,
and I objected.&nbsp; Both the expressions flitting over her
face, and the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly;
and brought to my recollection her former illness, and the
doctor&rsquo;s injunction that she should not be crossed.&nbsp; A
minute previously she was violent; now, supported on one arm, and
not noticing my refusal to obey her, she seemed to find childish
diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had just
made, and ranging them on the sheet according to their different
species: her mind had strayed to other associations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a turkey&rsquo;s,&rsquo; she murmured to
herself; &lsquo;and this is a wild duck&rsquo;s; and this is a
pigeon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Ah, they put pigeons&rsquo; feathers in the
pillows&mdash;no wonder I couldn&rsquo;t die!&nbsp; Let me take
care to throw it on the floor when I lie down.&nbsp; And here is
a moor-cock&rsquo;s; and this&mdash;I should know it among a
thousand&mdash;it&rsquo;s a lapwing&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Bonny bird;
wheeling over our heads in the middle of the moor.&nbsp; It
wanted to get to its nest, for the clouds had touched the swells,
and it felt rain coming.&nbsp; This feather was picked up from
the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its nest in the winter,
full of little skeletons.&nbsp; Heathcliff set a trap over it,
and the old ones dared not come.&nbsp; I made him promise
he&rsquo;d never shoot a lapwing after that, and he
didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Yes, here are more!&nbsp; Did he shoot my
lapwings, Nelly?&nbsp; Are they red, any of them?&nbsp; Let me
look.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give over with that baby-work!&rsquo; I interrupted,
dragging the pillow away, and turning the holes towards the
mattress, for she was removing its contents by handfuls.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lie down and shut your eyes: you&rsquo;re wandering.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a mess!&nbsp; The down is flying about like
snow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I went here and there collecting it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see in you, Nelly,&rsquo; she continued dreamily,
&lsquo;an aged woman: you have grey hair and bent
shoulders.&nbsp; This bed is the fairy cave under Penistone
crags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers;
pretending, while I am near, that they are only locks of
wool.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll come to fifty years
hence: I know you are not so now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not wandering:
you&rsquo;re mistaken, or else I should believe you really
<i>were</i> that withered hag, and I should think I <i>was</i>
under Penistone Crags; and I&rsquo;m conscious it&rsquo;s night,
and there are two candles on the table making the black press
shine like jet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The black press? where is that?&rsquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are talking in your sleep!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s against the wall, as it always is,&rsquo;
she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;It <i>does</i> appear odd&mdash;I see a
face in it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no press in the room, and never
was,&rsquo; said I, resuming my seat, and looping up the curtain
that I might watch her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t <i>you</i> see that face?&rsquo; she
inquired, gazing earnestly at the mirror.</p>
<p>And say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend
it to be her own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s behind there still!&rsquo; she pursued,
anxiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;And it stirred.&nbsp; Who is it?&nbsp; I
hope it will not come out when you are gone!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp;
Nelly, the room is haunted!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid of being
alone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a
succession of shudders convulsed her frame, and she would keep
straining her gaze towards the glass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nobody here!&rsquo; I insisted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It was <i>yourself</i>, Mrs. Linton: you knew it a while
since.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Myself!&rsquo; she gasped, &lsquo;and the clock is
striking twelve!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true, then! that&rsquo;s
dreadful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her
eyes.&nbsp; I attempted to steal to the door with an intention of
calling her husband; but I was summoned back by a piercing
shriek&mdash;the shawl had dropped from the frame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what is the matter?&rsquo; cried I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who is coward now?&nbsp; Wake up!&nbsp; That is the
glass&mdash;the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it,
and there am I too by your side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror
gradually passed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to
a glow of shame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, dear!&nbsp; I thought I was at home,&rsquo; she
sighed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought I was lying in my chamber at
Wuthering Heights.&nbsp; Because I&rsquo;m weak, my brain got
confused, and I screamed unconsciously.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say
anything; but stay with me.&nbsp; I dread sleeping: my dreams
appal me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A sound sleep would do you good, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; I
answered: &lsquo;and I hope this suffering will prevent your
trying starving again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old
house!&rsquo; she went on bitterly, wringing her hands.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice.&nbsp;
Do let me feel it&mdash;it comes straight down the moor&mdash;do
let me have one breath!&rsquo;&nbsp; To pacify her I held the
casement ajar a few seconds.&nbsp; A cold blast rushed through; I
closed it, and returned to my post.&nbsp; She lay still now, her
face bathed in tears.&nbsp; Exhaustion of body had entirely
subdued her spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a
wailing child.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long is it since I shut myself in here?&rsquo; she
asked, suddenly reviving.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was Monday evening,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;and
this is Thursday night, or rather Friday morning, at
present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! of the same week?&rsquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Only that brief time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and
ill-temper,&rsquo; observed I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it seems a weary number of hours,&rsquo; she
muttered doubtfully: &lsquo;it must be more.&nbsp; I remember
being in the parlour after they had quarrelled, and Edgar being
cruelly provoking, and me running into this room desperate.&nbsp;
As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness
overwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
explain to Edgar how certain I felt of having a fit, or going
raging mad, if he persisted in teasing me!&nbsp; I had no command
of tongue, or brain, and he did not guess my agony, perhaps: it
barely left me sense to try to escape from him and his
voice.&nbsp; Before I recovered sufficiently to see and hear, it
began to be dawn, and, Nelly, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I thought,
and what has kept recurring and recurring till I feared for my
reason.&nbsp; I thought as I lay there, with my head against that
table leg, and my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the
window, that I was enclosed in the oak-panelled bed at home; and
my heart ached with some great grief which, just waking, I could
not recollect.&nbsp; I pondered, and worried myself to discover
what it could be, and, most strangely, the whole last seven years
of my life grew a blank!&nbsp; I did not recall that they had
been at all.&nbsp; I was a child; my father was just buried, and
my misery arose from the separation that Hindley had ordered
between me and Heathcliff.&nbsp; I was laid alone, for the first
time; and, rousing from a dismal doze after a night of weeping, I
lifted my hand to push the panels aside: it struck the
table-top!&nbsp; I swept it along the carpet, and then memory
burst in: my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of
despair.&nbsp; I cannot say why I felt so wildly wretched: it
must have been temporary derangement; for there is scarcely
cause.&nbsp; But, supposing at twelve years old I had been
wrenched from the Heights, and every early association, and my
all in all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and been converted at
a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross Grange, and
the wife of a stranger: an exile, and outcast, thenceforth, from
what had been my world.&nbsp; You may fancy a glimpse of the
abyss where I grovelled!&nbsp; Shake your head as you will,
Nelly, you have helped to unsettle me!&nbsp; You should have
spoken to Edgar, indeed you should, and compelled him to leave me
quiet!&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m burning!&nbsp; I wish I were out of
doors!&nbsp; I wish I were a girl again, half savage and hardy,
and free; and laughing at injuries, not maddening under
them!&nbsp; Why am I so changed? why does my blood rush into a
hell of tumult at a few words?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I should be
myself were I once among the heather on those hills.&nbsp; Open
the window again wide: fasten it open!&nbsp; Quick, why
don&rsquo;t you move?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I won&rsquo;t give you your death of
cold,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t give me a chance of life, you
mean,&rsquo; she said, sullenly.&nbsp; &lsquo;However, I&rsquo;m
not helpless yet; I&rsquo;ll open it myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she
crossed the room, walking very uncertainly, threw it back, and
bent out, careless of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders
as keen as a knife.&nbsp; I entreated, and finally attempted to
force her to retire.&nbsp; But I soon found her delirious
strength much surpassed mine (she was delirious, I became
convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings).&nbsp; There was
no moon, and everything beneath lay in misty darkness: not a
light gleamed from any house, far or near all had been
extinguished long ago: and those at Wuthering Heights were never
visible&mdash;still she asserted she caught their shining.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look!&rsquo; she cried eagerly, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s my
room with the candle in it, and the trees swaying before it; and
the other candle is in Joseph&rsquo;s garret.&nbsp; Joseph sits
up late, doesn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s waiting till I come
home that he may lock the gate.&nbsp; Well, he&rsquo;ll wait a
while yet.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a rough journey, and a sad heart to
travel it; and we must pass by Gimmerton Kirk to go that
journey!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve braved its ghosts often together, and
dared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to
come.&nbsp; But, Heathcliff, if I dare you now, will you
venture?&nbsp; If you do, I&rsquo;ll keep you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
not lie there by myself: they may bury me twelve feet deep, and
throw the church down over me, but I won&rsquo;t rest till you
are with me.&nbsp; I never will!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She paused, and resumed with a strange smile.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s considering&mdash;he&rsquo;d rather I&rsquo;d
come to him!&nbsp; Find a way, then! not through that
kirkyard.&nbsp; You are slow!&nbsp; Be content, you always
followed me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was
planning how I could reach something to wrap about her, without
quitting my hold of herself (for I could not trust her alone by
the gaping lattice), when, to my consternation, I heard the
rattle of the door-handle, and Mr. Linton entered.&nbsp; He had
only then come from the library; and, in passing through the
lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity,
or fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, sir!&rsquo; I cried, checking the exclamation risen
to his lips at the sight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere
of the chamber.&nbsp; &lsquo;My poor mistress is ill, and she
quite masters me: I cannot manage her at all; pray, come and
persuade her to go to bed.&nbsp; Forget your anger, for
she&rsquo;s hard to guide any way but her own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Catherine ill?&rsquo; he said, hastening to us.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Shut the window, Ellen!&nbsp; Catherine!
why&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was silent.&nbsp; The haggardness of Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s
appearance smote him speechless, and he could only glance from
her to me in horrified astonishment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s been fretting here,&rsquo; I continued,
&lsquo;and eating scarcely anything, and never complaining: she
would admit none of us till this evening, and so we
couldn&rsquo;t inform you of her state, as we were not aware of
it ourselves; but it is nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master
frowned.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is nothing, is it, Ellen Dean?&rsquo; he
said sternly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You shall account more clearly for
keeping me ignorant of this!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he took his wife in
his arms, and looked at her with anguish.</p>
<p>At first she gave him no glance of recognition: he was
invisible to her abstracted gaze.&nbsp; The delirium was not
fixed, however; having weaned her eyes from contemplating the
outer darkness, by degrees she centred her attention on him, and
discovered who it was that held her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?&rsquo; she
said, with angry animation.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are one of those
things that are ever found when least wanted, and when you are
wanted, never!&nbsp; I suppose we shall have plenty of
lamentations now&mdash;I see we shall&mdash;but they can&rsquo;t
keep me from my narrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where
I&rsquo;m bound before spring is over!&nbsp; There it is: not
among the Lintons, mind, under the chapel-roof, but in the open
air, with a head-stone; and you may please yourself whether you
go to them or come to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Catherine, what have you done?&rsquo; commenced the
master.&nbsp; &lsquo;Am I nothing to you any more?&nbsp; Do you
love that wretch Heath&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hush, this
moment!&nbsp; You mention that name and I end the matter
instantly by a spring from the window!&nbsp; What you touch at
present you may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top before
you lay hands on me again.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want you, Edgar:
I&rsquo;m past wanting you.&nbsp; Return to your books.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m glad you possess a consolation, for all you had in me
is gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her mind wanders, sir,&rsquo; I interposed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She has been talking nonsense the whole evening; but let
her have quiet, and proper attendance, and she&rsquo;ll
rally.&nbsp; Hereafter, we must be cautious how we vex
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I desire no further advice from you,&rsquo; answered
Mr. Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;You knew your mistress&rsquo;s nature,
and you encouraged me to harass her.&nbsp; And not to give me one
hint of how she has been these three days!&nbsp; It was
heartless!&nbsp; Months of sickness could not cause such a
change!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for
another&rsquo;s wicked waywardness.&nbsp; &lsquo;I knew Mrs.
Linton&rsquo;s nature to be headstrong and domineering,&rsquo;
cried I: &lsquo;but I didn&rsquo;t know that you wished to foster
her fierce temper!&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know that, to humour her,
I should wink at Mr. Heathcliff.&nbsp; I performed the duty of a
faithful servant in telling you, and I have got a faithful
servant&rsquo;s wages!&nbsp; Well, it will teach me to be careful
next time.&nbsp; Next time you may gather intelligence for
yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my
service, Ellen Dean,&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d rather hear nothing about it, I suppose,
then, Mr. Linton?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Heathcliff has your
permission to come a-courting to Miss, and to drop in at every
opportunity your absence offers, on purpose to poison the
mistress against you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Confused as Catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our
conversation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; Nelly has played traitor,&rsquo; she
exclaimed, passionately.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nelly is my hidden
enemy.&nbsp; You witch!&nbsp; So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt
us!&nbsp; Let me go, and I&rsquo;ll make her rue!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll make her howl a recantation!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A maniac&rsquo;s fury kindled under her brows; she struggled
desperately to disengage herself from Linton&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp;
I felt no inclination to tarry the event; and, resolving to seek
medical aid on my own responsibility, I quitted the chamber.</p>
<p>In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a
bridle hook is driven into the wall, I saw something white moved
irregularly, evidently by another agent than the wind.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding my hurry, I stayed to examine it, lest ever after
I should have the conviction impressed on my imagination that it
was a creature of the other world.&nbsp; My surprise and
perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more than vision,
Miss Isabella&rsquo;s springer, Fanny, suspended by a
handkerchief, and nearly at its last gasp.&nbsp; I quickly
released the animal, and lifted it into the garden.&nbsp; I had
seen it follow its mistress up-stairs when she went to bed; and
wondered much how it could have got out there, and what
mischievous person had treated it so.&nbsp; While untying the
knot round the hook, it seemed to me that I repeatedly caught the
beat of horses&rsquo; feet galloping at some distance; but there
were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that I
hardly gave the circumstance a thought: though it was a strange
sound, in that place, at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see
a patient in the village as I came up the street; and my account
of Catherine Linton&rsquo;s malady induced him to accompany me
back immediately.&nbsp; He was a plain rough man; and he made no
scruple to speak his doubts of her surviving this second attack;
unless she were more submissive to his directions than she had
shown herself before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nelly Dean,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help
fancying there&rsquo;s an extra cause for this.&nbsp; What has
there been to do at the Grange?&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve odd reports up
here.&nbsp; A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill
for a trifle; and that sort of people should not either.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s hard work bringing them through fevers, and such
things.&nbsp; How did it begin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The master will inform you,&rsquo; I answered;
&lsquo;but you are acquainted with the Earnshaws&rsquo; violent
dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all.&nbsp; I may say
this; it commenced in a quarrel.&nbsp; She was struck during a
tempest of passion with a kind of fit.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s her
account, at least: for she flew off in the height of it, and
locked herself up.&nbsp; Afterwards, she refused to eat, and now
she alternately raves and remains in a half dream; knowing those
about her, but having her mind filled with all sorts of strange
ideas and illusions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Linton will be sorry?&rsquo; observed Kenneth,
interrogatively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sorry? he&rsquo;ll break his heart should anything
happen!&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t alarm him more
than necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I told him to beware,&rsquo; said my companion;
&lsquo;and he must bide the consequences of neglecting my
warning!&nbsp; Hasn&rsquo;t he been intimate with Mr. Heathcliff
lately?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,&rsquo;
answered I, &lsquo;though more on the strength of the mistress
having known him when a boy, than because the master likes his
company.&nbsp; At present he&rsquo;s discharged from the trouble
of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after Miss
Linton which he manifested.&nbsp; I hardly think he&rsquo;ll be
taken in again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on
him?&rsquo; was the doctor&rsquo;s next question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not in her confidence,&rsquo; returned I,
reluctant to continue the subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, she&rsquo;s a sly one,&rsquo; he remarked, shaking
his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;She keeps her own counsel!&nbsp; But
she&rsquo;s a real little fool.&nbsp; I have it from good
authority that last night (and a pretty night it was!) she and
Heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your
house above two hours; and he pressed her not to go in again, but
just mount his horse and away with him!&nbsp; My informant said
she could only put him off by pledging her word of honour to be
prepared on their first meeting after that: when it was to be he
didn&rsquo;t hear; but you urge Mr. Linton to look
sharp!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth,
and ran most of the way back.&nbsp; The little dog was yelping in
the garden yet.&nbsp; I spared a minute to open the gate for it,
but instead of going to the house door, it coursed up and down
snuffing the grass, and would have escaped to the road, had I not
seized it and conveyed it in with me.&nbsp; On ascending to
Isabella&rsquo;s room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was
empty.&nbsp; Had I been a few hours sooner Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s
illness might have arrested her rash step.&nbsp; But what could
be done now?&nbsp; There was a bare possibility of overtaking
them if pursued instantly.&nbsp; <i>I</i> could not pursue them,
however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the place
with confusion; still less unfold the business to my master,
absorbed as he was in his present calamity, and having no heart
to spare for a second grief!&nbsp; I saw nothing for it but to
hold my tongue, and suffer matters to take their course; and
Kenneth being arrived, I went with a badly composed countenance
to announce him.&nbsp; Catherine lay in a troubled sleep: her
husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of frenzy; he now
hung over her pillow, watching every shade and every change of
her painfully expressive features.</p>
<p>The doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully
to him of its having a favourable termination, if we could only
preserve around her perfect and constant tranquillity.&nbsp; To
me, he signified the threatening danger was not so much death, as
permanent alienation of intellect.</p>
<p>I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton:
indeed, we never went to bed; and the servants were all up long
before the usual hour, moving through the house with stealthy
tread, and exchanging whispers as they encountered each other in
their vocations.&nbsp; Every one was active but Miss Isabella;
and they began to remark how sound she slept: her brother, too,
asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient for her presence,
and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her
sister-in-law.&nbsp; I trembled lest he should send me to call
her; but I was spared the pain of being the first proclaimant of
her flight.&nbsp; One of the maids, a thoughtless girl, who had
been on an early errand to Gimmerton, came panting up-stairs,
open-mouthed, and dashed into the chamber, crying: &lsquo;Oh,
dear, dear!&nbsp; What mun we have next?&nbsp; Master, master,
our young lady&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold your noise!&rsquo; cried, I hastily, enraged at
her clamorous manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speak lower, Mary&mdash;What is the matter?&rsquo; said
Mr. Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;What ails your young lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s gone, she&rsquo;s gone!&nbsp; Yon&rsquo;
Heathcliff&rsquo;s run off wi&rsquo; her!&rsquo; gasped the
girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is not true!&rsquo; exclaimed Linton, rising in
agitation.&nbsp; &lsquo;It cannot be: how has the idea entered
your head?&nbsp; Ellen Dean, go and seek her.&nbsp; It is
incredible: it cannot be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated
his demand to know her reasons for such an assertion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk
here,&rsquo; she stammered, &lsquo;and he asked whether we
weren&rsquo;t in trouble at the Grange.&nbsp; I thought he meant
for missis&rsquo;s sickness, so I answered, yes.&nbsp; Then says
he, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody gone after &rsquo;em, I
guess?&rdquo;&nbsp; I stared.&nbsp; He saw I knew nought about
it, and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a
horse&rsquo;s shoe fastened at a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, two
miles out of Gimmerton, not very long after midnight! and how the
blacksmith&rsquo;s lass had got up to spy who they were: she knew
them both directly.&nbsp; And she noticed the
man&mdash;Heathcliff it was, she felt certain: nob&rsquo;dy could
mistake him, besides&mdash;put a sovereign in her father&rsquo;s
hand for payment.&nbsp; The lady had a cloak about her face; but
having desired a sup of water, while she drank it fell back, and
she saw her very plain.&nbsp; Heathcliff held both bridles as
they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and went
as fast as the rough roads would let them.&nbsp; The lass said
nothing to her father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I ran and peeped, for form&rsquo;s sake, into Isabella&rsquo;s
room; confirming, when I returned, the servant&rsquo;s
statement.&nbsp; Mr. Linton had resumed his seat by the bed; on
my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the meaning of my blank
aspect, and dropped them without giving an order, or uttering a
word.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing
her back,&rsquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;How should we
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She went of her own accord,&rsquo; answered the master;
&lsquo;she had a right to go if she pleased.&nbsp; Trouble me no
more about her.&nbsp; Hereafter she is only my sister in name:
not because I disown her, but because she has disowned
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And that was all he said on the subject: he did not make
single inquiry further, or mention her in any way, except
directing me to send what property she had in the house to her
fresh home, wherever it was, when I knew it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>For two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two
months, Mrs. Linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of
what was denominated a brain fever.&nbsp; No mother could have
nursed an only child more devotedly than Edgar tended her.&nbsp;
Day and night he was watching, and patiently enduring all the
annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason could
inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he saved from the
grave would only recompense his care by forming the source of
constant future anxiety&mdash;in fact, that his health and
strength were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of
humanity&mdash;he knew no limits in gratitude and joy when
Catherine&rsquo;s life was declared out of danger; and hour after
hour he would sit beside her, tracing the gradual return to
bodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the
illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance
also, and she would soon be entirely her former self.</p>
<p>The first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of
the following March.&nbsp; Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in
the morning, a handful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger
to any gleam of pleasure, caught them in waking, and shone
delighted as she gathered them eagerly together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,&rsquo;
she exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;They remind me of soft thaw winds,
and warm sunshine, and nearly melted snow.&nbsp; Edgar, is there
not a south wind, and is not the snow almost gone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The snow is quite gone down here, darling,&rsquo;
replied her husband; &lsquo;and I only see two white spots on the
whole range of moors: the sky is blue, and the larks are singing,
and the becks and brooks are all brim full.&nbsp; Catherine, last
spring at this time, I was longing to have you under this roof;
now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the air blows
so sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall never be there but once more,&rsquo; said the
invalid; &lsquo;and then you&rsquo;ll leave me, and I shall
remain for ever.&nbsp; Next spring you&rsquo;ll long again to
have me under this roof, and you&rsquo;ll look back and think you
were happy to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to
cheer her by the fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the
flowers, she let the tears collect on her lashes and stream down
her cheeks unheeding.&nbsp; We knew she was really better, and,
therefore, decided that long confinement to a single place
produced much of this despondency, and it might be partially
removed by a change of scene.&nbsp; The master told me to light a
fire in the many-weeks&rsquo; deserted parlour, and to set an
easy-chair in the sunshine by the window; and then he brought her
down, and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat, and, as
we expected, revived by the objects round her: which, though
familiar, were free from the dreary associations investing her
hated sick chamber.&nbsp; By evening she seemed greatly
exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that
apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed,
till another room could be prepared.&nbsp; To obviate the fatigue
of mounting and descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where
you lie at present&mdash;on the same floor with the parlour; and
she was soon strong enough to move from one to the other, leaning
on Edgar&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; Ah, I thought myself, she might
recover, so waited on as she was.&nbsp; And there was double
cause to desire it, for on her existence depended that of
another: we cherished the hope that in a little while Mr.
Linton&rsquo;s heart would be gladdened, and his lands secured
from a stranger&rsquo;s grip, by the birth of an heir.</p>
<p>I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six
weeks from her departure, a short note, announcing her marriage
with Heathcliff.&nbsp; It appeared dry and cold; but at the
bottom was dotted in with pencil an obscure apology, and an
entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation, if her
proceeding had offended him: asserting that she could not help it
then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal it.&nbsp;
Linton did not reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight
more, I got a long letter, which I considered odd, coming from
the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
read it: for I keep it yet.&nbsp; Any relic of the dead is
precious, if they were valued living.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>, it begins,&mdash;I came
last night to Wuthering Heights, and heard, for the first time,
that Catherine has been, and is yet, very ill.&nbsp; I must not
write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too angry or
too distressed to answer what I sent him.&nbsp; Still, I must
write to somebody, and the only choice left me is you.</p>
<p>Inform Edgar that I&rsquo;d give the world to see his face
again&mdash;that my heart returned to Thrushcross Grange in
twenty-four hours after I left it, and is there at this moment,
full of warm feelings for him, and Catherine!&nbsp; <i>I
can&rsquo;t follow it though</i>&mdash;(these words are
underlined)&mdash;they need not expect me, and they may draw what
conclusions they please; taking care, however, to lay nothing at
the door of my weak will or deficient affection.</p>
<p>The remainder of the letter is for yourself alone.&nbsp; I
want to ask you two questions: the first is,&mdash;How did you
contrive to preserve the common sympathies of human nature when
you resided here?&nbsp; I cannot recognise any sentiment which
those around share with me.</p>
<p>The second question I have great interest in; it is
this&mdash;Is Mr. Heathcliff a man?&nbsp; If so, is he mad?&nbsp;
And if not, is he a devil?&nbsp; I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t tell my
reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to explain, if
you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see me;
and you must call, Ellen, very soon.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t write, but
come, and bring me something from Edgar.</p>
<p>Now, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home,
as I am led to imagine the Heights will be.&nbsp; It is to amuse
myself that I dwell on such subjects as the lack of external
comforts: they never occupy my thoughts, except at the moment
when I miss them.&nbsp; I should laugh and dance for joy, if I
found their absence was the total of my miseries, and the rest
was an unnatural dream!</p>
<p>The sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by
that, I judged it to be six o&rsquo;clock; and my companion
halted half an hour, to inspect the park, and the gardens, and,
probably, the place itself, as well as he could; so it was dark
when we dismounted in the paved yard of the farm-house, and your
old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to receive us by the light
of a dip candle.&nbsp; He did it with a courtesy that redounded
to his credit.&nbsp; His first act was to elevate his torch to a
level with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip,
and turn away.&nbsp; Then he took the two horses, and led them
into the stables; reappearing for the purpose of locking the
outer gate, as if we lived in an ancient castle.</p>
<p>Heathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the
kitchen&mdash;a dingy, untidy hole; I daresay you would not know
it, it is so changed since it was in your charge.&nbsp; By the
fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb and dirty in garb,
with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his mouth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is Edgar&rsquo;s legal nephew,&rsquo; I
reflected&mdash;&lsquo;mine in a manner; I must shake hands,
and&mdash;yes&mdash;I must kiss him.&nbsp; It is right to
establish a good understanding at the beginning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I approached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist,
said&mdash;&lsquo;How do you do, my dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He replied in a jargon I did not comprehend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall you and I be friends, Hareton?&rsquo; was my next
essay at conversation.</p>
<p>An oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not
&lsquo;frame off&rsquo; rewarded my perseverance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hey, Throttler, lad!&rsquo; whispered the little
wretch, rousing a half-bred bull-dog from its lair in a
corner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, wilt thou be ganging?&rsquo; he asked
authoritatively.</p>
<p>Love for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the
threshold to wait till the others should enter.&nbsp; Mr.
Heathcliff was nowhere visible; and Joseph, whom I followed to
the stables, and requested to accompany me in, after staring and
muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and
replied&mdash;&lsquo;Mim! mim! mim!&nbsp; Did iver Christian body
hear aught like it?&nbsp; Mincing un&rsquo; munching!&nbsp; How
can I tell whet ye say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, I wish you to come with me into the
house!&rsquo; I cried, thinking him deaf, yet highly disgusted at
his rudeness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;None o&rsquo; me!&nbsp; I getten summut else to
do,&rsquo; he answered, and continued his work; moving his
lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and countenance
(the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I&rsquo;m
sure, as sad as he could desire) with sovereign contempt.</p>
<p>I walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another
door, at which I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more
civil servant might show himself.&nbsp; After a short suspense,
it was opened by a tall, gaunt man, without neckerchief, and
otherwise extremely slovenly; his features were lost in masses of
shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders; and <i>his</i> eyes, too,
were like a ghostly Catherine&rsquo;s with all their beauty
annihilated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s your business here?&rsquo; he demanded,
grimly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My name was Isabella Linton,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve seen me before, sir.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m lately
married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here&mdash;I
suppose, by your permission.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he come back, then?&rsquo; asked the hermit, glaring
like a hungry wolf.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;we came just now,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;but
he left me by the kitchen door; and when I would have gone in,
your little boy played sentinel over the place, and frightened me
off by the help of a bull-dog.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s well the hellish villain has kept his
word!&rsquo; growled my future host, searching the darkness
beyond me in expectation of discovering Heathcliff; and then he
indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and threats of what he
would have done had the &lsquo;fiend&rsquo; deceived him.</p>
<p>I repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost
inclined to slip away before he finished cursing, but ere I could
execute that intention, he ordered me in, and shut and
re-fastened the door.&nbsp; There was a great fire, and that was
all the light in the huge apartment, whose floor had grown a
uniform grey; and the once brilliant pewter-dishes, which used to
attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook of a similar
obscurity, created by tarnish and dust.&nbsp; I inquired whether
I might call the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom!&nbsp; Mr.
Earnshaw vouchsafed no answer.&nbsp; He walked up and down, with
his hands in his pockets, apparently quite forgetting my
presence; and his abstraction was evidently so deep, and his
whole aspect so misanthropical, that I shrank from disturbing him
again.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling
particularly cheerless, seated in worse than solitude on that
inhospitable hearth, and remembering that four miles distant lay
my delightful home, containing the only people I loved on earth;
and there might as well be the Atlantic to part us, instead of
those four miles: I could not overpass them!&nbsp; I questioned
with myself&mdash;where must I turn for comfort? and&mdash;mind
you don&rsquo;t tell Edgar, or Catherine&mdash;above every sorrow
beside, this rose pre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who
could or would be my ally against Heathcliff!&nbsp; I had sought
shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost gladly, because I was
secured by that arrangement from living alone with him; but he
knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not fear their
intermeddling.</p>
<p>I sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and
nine, and still my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on
his breast, and perfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter
ejaculation forced itself out at intervals.&nbsp; I listened to
detect a woman&rsquo;s voice in the house, and filled the interim
with wild regrets and dismal anticipations, which, at last, spoke
audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping.&nbsp; I was not
aware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in his
measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened
surprise.&nbsp; Taking advantage of his recovered attention, I
exclaimed&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m tired with my journey, and I
want to go to bed!&nbsp; Where is the maid-servant?&nbsp; Direct
me to her, as she won&rsquo;t come to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have none,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;you must wait
on yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where must I sleep, then?&rsquo; I sobbed; I was beyond
regarding self-respect, weighed down by fatigue and
wretchedness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Joseph will show you Heathcliff&rsquo;s chamber,&rsquo;
said he; &lsquo;open that door&mdash;he&rsquo;s in
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in
the strangest tone&mdash;&lsquo;Be so good as to turn your lock,
and draw your bolt&mdash;don&rsquo;t omit it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But why, Mr.
Earnshaw?&rsquo;&nbsp; I did not relish the notion of
deliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here!&rsquo; he replied, pulling from his
waistcoat a curiously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged
spring knife attached to the barrel.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a
great tempter to a desperate man, is it not?&nbsp; I cannot
resist going up with this every night, and trying his door.&nbsp;
If once I find it open he&rsquo;s done for; I do it invariably,
even though the minute before I have been recalling a hundred
reasons that should make me refrain: it is some devil that urges
me to thwart my own schemes by killing him.&nbsp; You fight
against that devil for love as long as you may; when the time
comes, not all the angels in heaven shall save him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I surveyed the weapon inquisitively.&nbsp; A hideous notion
struck me: how powerful I should be possessing such an
instrument!&nbsp; I took it from his hand, and touched the
blade.&nbsp; He looked astonished at the expression my face
assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was
covetousness.&nbsp; He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut
the knife, and returned it to its concealment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you tell him,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Put him on his guard, and watch for him.&nbsp;
You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not shock
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What has Heathcliff done to you?&rsquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;In what has he wronged you, to warrant this appalling
hatred?&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wiser to bid him quit the
house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; thundered Earnshaw; &lsquo;should he offer
to leave me, he&rsquo;s a dead man: persuade him to attempt it,
and you are a murderess!&nbsp; Am I to lose <i>all</i>, without a
chance of retrieval?&nbsp; Is Hareton to be a beggar?&nbsp; Oh,
damnation!&nbsp; I <i>will</i> have it back; and I&rsquo;ll have
<i>his</i> gold too; and then his blood; and hell shall have his
soul!&nbsp; It will be ten times blacker with that guest than
ever it was before!&rsquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve acquainted me, Ellen, with your old
master&rsquo;s habits.&nbsp; He is clearly on the verge of
madness: he was so last night at least.&nbsp; I shuddered to be
near him, and thought on the servant&rsquo;s ill-bred moroseness
as comparatively agreeable.&nbsp; He now recommenced his moody
walk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen.&nbsp;
Joseph was bending over the fire, peering into a large pan that
swung above it; and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle
close by.&nbsp; The contents of the pan began to boil, and he
turned to plunge his hand into the bowl; I conjectured that this
preparation was probably for our supper, and, being hungry, I
resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out sharply,
&lsquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> make the porridge!&rsquo;&nbsp; I
removed the vessel out of his reach, and proceeded to take off my
hat and riding-habit.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Earnshaw,&rsquo; I
continued, &lsquo;directs me to wait on myself: I will.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not going to act the lady among you, for fear I should
starve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gooid Lord!&rsquo; he muttered, sitting down, and
stroking his ribbed stockings from the knee to the ankle.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If there&rsquo;s to be fresh ortherings&mdash;just when I
getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev&rsquo; a
<i>mistress</i> set o&rsquo;er my heead, it&rsquo;s like time to
be flitting.&nbsp; I niver <i>did</i> think to see t&rsquo; day
that I mud lave th&rsquo; owld place&mdash;but I doubt it&rsquo;s
nigh at hand!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to
work, sighing to remember a period when it would have been all
merry fun; but compelled speedily to drive off the
remembrance.&nbsp; It racked me to recall past happiness and the
greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition, the
quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the handfuls of meal
fell into the water.&nbsp; Joseph beheld my style of cookery with
growing indignation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thear!&rsquo; he ejaculated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hareton, thou
willn&rsquo;t sup thy porridge to-neeght; they&rsquo;ll be naught
but lumps as big as my neive.&nbsp; Thear, agean!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
fling in bowl un&rsquo; all, if I wer ye!&nbsp; There, pale
t&rsquo; guilp off, un&rsquo; then ye&rsquo;ll hae done wi&rsquo;
&lsquo;t.&nbsp; Bang, bang.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a mercy t&rsquo;
bothom isn&rsquo;t deaved out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the
basins; four had been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk
was brought from the dairy, which Hareton seized and commenced
drinking and spilling from the expansive lip.&nbsp; I
expostulated, and desired that he should have his in a mug;
affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so
dirtily.&nbsp; The old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this
nicety; assuring me, repeatedly, that &lsquo;the barn was every
bit as good&rsquo; as I, &lsquo;and every bit as wollsome,&rsquo;
and wondering how I could fashion to be so conceited.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and glowered up
at me defyingly, as he slavered into the jug.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall have my supper in another room,&rsquo; I
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you no place you call a
parlour?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Parlour</i>!&rsquo; he echoed, sneeringly,
&lsquo;<i>parlour</i>!&nbsp; Nay, we&rsquo;ve noa
<i>parlours</i>.&nbsp; If yah dunnut loike wer company,
there&rsquo;s maister&rsquo;s; un&rsquo; if yah dunnut loike
maister, there&rsquo;s us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I shall go up-stairs,&rsquo; I answered;
&lsquo;show me a chamber.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more
milk.&nbsp; With great grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded
me in my ascent: we mounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now
and then, to look into the apartments we passed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a rahm,&rsquo; he said, at last, flinging
back a cranky board on hinges.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s weel
eneugh to ate a few porridge in.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a pack
o&rsquo; corn i&rsquo; t&rsquo; corner, thear, meeterly clane; if
ye&rsquo;re feared o&rsquo; muckying yer grand silk cloes, spread
yer hankerchir o&rsquo; t&rsquo; top on&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;rahm&rsquo; was a kind of lumber-hole smelling
strong of malt and grain; various sacks of which articles were
piled around, leaving a wide, bare space in the middle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, man,&rsquo; I exclaimed, facing him angrily,
&lsquo;this is not a place to sleep in.&nbsp; I wish to see my
bed-room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Bed-rume</i>!&rsquo; he repeated, in a tone of
mockery.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yah&rsquo;s see all t&rsquo;
<i>bed-rumes</i> thear is&mdash;yon&rsquo;s mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pointed into the second garret, only differing from the
first in being more naked about the walls, and having a large,
low, curtainless bed, with an indigo-coloured quilt, at one
end.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do I want with yours?&rsquo; I retorted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does not lodge at the top of the
house, does he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s Maister <i>Hathecliff&rsquo;s</i>
ye&rsquo;re wanting?&rsquo; cried he, as if making a new
discovery.&nbsp; &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t ye ha&rsquo; said soa, at
onst? un&rsquo; then, I mud ha&rsquo; telled ye, baht all this
wark, that that&rsquo;s just one ye cannut see&mdash;he allas
keeps it locked, un&rsquo; nob&rsquo;dy iver mells on&rsquo;t but
hisseln.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve a nice house, Joseph,&rsquo; I could not
refrain from observing, &lsquo;and pleasant inmates; and I think
the concentrated essence of all the madness in the world took up
its abode in my brain the day I linked my fate with theirs!&nbsp;
However, that is not to the present purpose&mdash;there are other
rooms.&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s sake be quick, and let me settle
somewhere!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He made no reply to this adjuration; only plodding doggedly
down the wooden steps, and halting, before an apartment which,
from that halt and the superior quality of its furniture, I
conjectured to be the best one.&nbsp; There was a carpet&mdash;a
good one, but the pattern was obliterated by dust; a fireplace
hung with cut-paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome oak-bedstead
with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and
modern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the
vallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the
iron rod supporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing
the drapery to trail upon the floor.&nbsp; The chairs were also
damaged, many of them severely; and deep indentations deformed
the panels of the walls.&nbsp; I was endeavouring to gather
resolution for entering and taking possession, when my fool of a
guide announced,&mdash;&lsquo;This here is t&rsquo;
maister&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&nbsp; My supper by this time was cold, my
appetite gone, and my patience exhausted.&nbsp; I insisted on
being provided instantly with a place of refuge, and means of
repose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whear the divil?&rsquo; began the religious
elder.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Lord bless us!&nbsp; The Lord forgie
us!&nbsp; Whear the <i>hell</i> wold ye gang? ye marred,
wearisome nowt!&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ve seen all but Hareton&rsquo;s
bit of a cham&rsquo;er.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not another hoile to
lig down in i&rsquo; th&rsquo; hahse!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the
ground; and then seated myself at the stairs&rsquo;-head, hid my
face in my hands, and cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ech! ech!&rsquo; exclaimed Joseph.&nbsp; &lsquo;Weel
done, Miss Cathy! weel done, Miss Cathy!&nbsp; Howsiver, t&rsquo;
maister sall just tum&rsquo;le o&rsquo;er them brooken pots;
un&rsquo; then we&rsquo;s hear summut; we&rsquo;s hear how
it&rsquo;s to be.&nbsp; Gooid-for-naught madling! ye desarve
pining fro&rsquo; this to Chrustmas, flinging t&rsquo; precious
gifts o&rsquo;God under fooit i&rsquo; yer flaysome rages!&nbsp;
But I&rsquo;m mista&rsquo;en if ye shew yer sperrit lang.&nbsp;
Will Hathecliff bide sich bonny ways, think ye?&nbsp; I nobbut
wish he may catch ye i&rsquo; that plisky.&nbsp; I nobbut wish he
may.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so he went on scolding to his den beneath, taking the
candle with him; and I remained in the dark.&nbsp; The period of
reflection succeeding this silly action compelled me to admit the
necessity of smothering my pride and choking my wrath, and
bestirring myself to remove its effects.&nbsp; An unexpected aid
presently appeared in the shape of Throttler, whom I now
recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had spent its
whelphood at the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr.
Hindley.&nbsp; I fancy it knew me: it pushed its nose against
mine by way of salute, and then hastened to devour the porridge;
while I groped from step to step, collecting the shattered
earthenware, and drying the spatters of milk from the banister
with my pocket-handkerchief.&nbsp; Our labours were scarcely over
when I heard Earnshaw&rsquo;s tread in the passage; my assistant
tucked in his tail, and pressed to the wall; I stole into the
nearest doorway.&nbsp; The dog&rsquo;s endeavour to avoid him was
unsuccessful; as I guessed by a scutter down-stairs, and a
prolonged, piteous yelping.&nbsp; I had better luck: he passed
on, entered his chamber, and shut the door.&nbsp; Directly after
Joseph came up with Hareton, to put him to bed.&nbsp; I had found
shelter in Hareton&rsquo;s room, and the old man, on seeing me,
said,&mdash;&lsquo;They&rsquo;s rahm for boath ye un&rsquo; yer
pride, now, I sud think i&rsquo; the hahse.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
empty; ye may hev&rsquo; it all to yerseln, un&rsquo; Him as
allus maks a third, i&rsquo; sich ill company!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute
I flung myself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and
slept.&nbsp; My slumber was deep and sweet, though over far too
soon.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he had just come in, and
demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing there?&nbsp; I
told him the cause of my staying up so late&mdash;that he had the
key of our room in his pocket.&nbsp; The adjective <i>our</i>
gave mortal offence.&nbsp; He swore it was not, nor ever should
be, mine; and he&rsquo;d&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll not repeat his
language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious and
unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence!&nbsp; I sometimes
wonder at him with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I
assure you, a tiger or a venomous serpent could not rouse terror
in me equal to that which he wakens.&nbsp; He told me of
Catherine&rsquo;s illness, and accused my brother of causing it
promising that I should be Edgar&rsquo;s proxy in suffering, till
he could get hold of him.</p>
<p>I do hate him&mdash;I am wretched&mdash;I have been a
fool!&nbsp; Beware of uttering one breath of this to any one at
the Grange.&nbsp; I shall expect you every day&mdash;don&rsquo;t
disappoint me!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isabella</span>.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>As soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master,
and informed him that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and
sent me a letter expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s
situation, and her ardent desire to see him; with a wish that he
would transmit to her, as early as possible, some token of
forgiveness by me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forgiveness!&rsquo; said Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
nothing to forgive her, Ellen.&nbsp; You may call at Wuthering
Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that I am not angry,
but I&rsquo;m sorry to have lost her; especially as I can never
think she&rsquo;ll be happy.&nbsp; It is out of the question my
going to see her, however: we are eternally divided; and should
she really wish to oblige me, let her persuade the villain she
has married to leave the country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you won&rsquo;t write her a little note,
sir?&rsquo; I asked, imploringly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
needless.&nbsp; My communication with Heathcliff&rsquo;s family
shall be as sparing as his with mine.&nbsp; It shall not
exist!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Edgar&rsquo;s coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all
the way from the Grange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart
into what he said, when I repeated it; and how to soften his
refusal of even a few lines to console Isabella.&nbsp; I daresay
she had been on the watch for me since morning: I saw her looking
through the lattice as I came up the garden causeway, and I
nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being
observed.&nbsp; I entered without knocking.&nbsp; There never was
such a dreary, dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house
presented!&nbsp; I must confess, that if I had been in the young
lady&rsquo;s place, I would, at least, have swept the hearth, and
wiped the tables with a duster.&nbsp; But she already partook of
the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her.&nbsp; Her
pretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks
hanging lankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her
head.&nbsp; Probably she had not touched her dress since yester
evening.&nbsp; Hindley was not there.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff sat at
a table, turning over some papers in his pocket-book; but he rose
when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite friendly, and offered
me a chair.&nbsp; He was the only thing there that seemed decent;
and I thought he never looked better.&nbsp; So much had
circumstances altered their positions, that he would certainly
have struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife
as a thorough little slattern!&nbsp; She came forward eagerly to
greet me, and held out one hand to take the expected
letter.&nbsp; I shook my head.&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t
understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I went
to lay my bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her
directly what I had brought.&nbsp; Heathcliff guessed the meaning
of her manoeuvres, and said&mdash;&lsquo;If you have got anything
for Isabella (as no doubt you have, Nelly), give it to her.&nbsp;
You needn&rsquo;t make a secret of it: we have no secrets between
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I have nothing,&rsquo; I replied, thinking it best
to speak the truth at once.&nbsp; &lsquo;My master bid me tell
his sister that she must not expect either a letter or a visit
from him at present.&nbsp; He sends his love, ma&rsquo;am, and
his wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you
have occasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household
and the household here should drop intercommunication, as nothing
could come of keeping it up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Heathcliff&rsquo;s lip quivered slightly, and she
returned to her seat in the window.&nbsp; Her husband took his
stand on the hearthstone, near me, and began to put questions
concerning Catherine.&nbsp; I told him as much as I thought
proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by
cross-examination, most of the facts connected with its
origin.&nbsp; I blamed her, as she deserved, for bringing it all
on herself; and ended by hoping that he would follow Mr.
Linton&rsquo;s example and avoid future interference with his
family, for good or evil.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Linton is now just recovering,&rsquo; I said;
&lsquo;she&rsquo;ll never be like she was, but her life is
spared; and if you really have a regard for her, you&rsquo;ll
shun crossing her way again: nay, you&rsquo;ll move out of this
country entirely; and that you may not regret it, I&rsquo;ll
inform you Catherine Linton is as different now from your old
friend Catherine Earnshaw, as that young lady is different from
me.&nbsp; Her appearance is changed greatly, her character much
more so; and the person who is compelled, of necessity, to be her
companion, will only sustain his affection hereafter by the
remembrance of what she once was, by common humanity, and a sense
of duty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is quite possible,&rsquo; remarked Heathcliff,
forcing himself to seem calm: &lsquo;quite possible that your
master should have nothing but common humanity and a sense of
duty to fall back upon.&nbsp; But do you imagine that I shall
leave Catherine to his <i>duty</i> and <i>humanity</i>? and can
you compare my feelings respecting Catherine to his?&nbsp; Before
you leave this house, I must exact a promise from you that
you&rsquo;ll get me an interview with her: consent, or refuse, I
<i>will</i> see her!&nbsp; What do you say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, Mr. Heathcliff,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;you
must not: you never shall, through my means.&nbsp; Another
encounter between you and the master would kill her
altogether.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With your aid that may be avoided,&rsquo; he continued;
&lsquo;and should there be danger of such an event&mdash;should
he be the cause of adding a single trouble more to her
existence&mdash;why, I think I shall be justified in going to
extremes!&nbsp; I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me
whether Catherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear
that she would restrains me.&nbsp; And there you see the
distinction between our feelings: had he been in my place, and I
in his, though I hated him with a hatred that turned my life to
gall, I never would have raised a hand against him.&nbsp; You may
look incredulous, if you please!&nbsp; I never would have
banished him from her society as long as she desired his.&nbsp;
The moment her regard ceased, I would have torn his heart out,
and drunk his blood!&nbsp; But, till then&mdash;if you
don&rsquo;t believe me, you don&rsquo;t know me&mdash;till then,
I would have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his
head!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; I interrupted, &lsquo;you have no
scruples in completely ruining all hopes of her perfect
restoration, by thrusting yourself into her remembrance now, when
she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her in a new tumult
of discord and distress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Nelly! you know she has not!&nbsp; You
know as well as I do, that for every thought she spends on Linton
she spends a thousand on me!&nbsp; At a most miserable period of
my life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my return
to the neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance
could make me admit the horrible idea again.&nbsp; And then,
Linton would be nothing, nor Hindley, nor all the dreams that
ever I dreamt.&nbsp; Two words would comprehend my
future&mdash;<i>death</i> and <i>hell</i>: existence, after
losing her, would be hell.&nbsp; Yet I was a fool to fancy for a
moment that she valued Edgar Linton&rsquo;s attachment more than
mine.&nbsp; If he loved with all the powers of his puny being, he
couldn&rsquo;t love as much in eighty years as I could in a
day.&nbsp; And Catherine has a heart as deep as I have: the sea
could be as readily contained in that horse-trough as her whole
affection be monopolised by him.&nbsp; Tush!&nbsp; He is scarcely
a degree dearer to her than her dog, or her horse.&nbsp; It is
not in him to be loved like me: how can she love in him what he
has not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any
two people can be,&rsquo; cried Isabella, with sudden
vivacity.&nbsp; &lsquo;No one has a right to talk in that manner,
and I won&rsquo;t hear my brother depreciated in
silence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn&rsquo;t
he?&rsquo; observed Heathcliff, scornfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;He turns
you adrift on the world with surprising alacrity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not aware of what I suffer,&rsquo; she
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell him that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have been telling him something, then: you have
written, have you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To say that I was married, I did write&mdash;you saw
the note.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And nothing since?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change
of condition,&rsquo; I remarked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Somebody&rsquo;s
love comes short in her case, obviously; whose, I may guess; but,
perhaps, I shouldn&rsquo;t say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should guess it was her own,&rsquo; said
Heathcliff.&nbsp; &lsquo;She degenerates into a mere slut!&nbsp;
She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d hardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding
she was weeping to go home.&nbsp; However, she&rsquo;ll suit this
house so much the better for not being over nice, and I&rsquo;ll
take care she does not disgrace me by rambling abroad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; returned I, &lsquo;I hope
you&rsquo;ll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff is accustomed to be
looked after and waited on; and that she has been brought up like
an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve.&nbsp; You
must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you
must treat her kindly.&nbsp; Whatever be your notion of Mr.
Edgar, you cannot doubt that she has a capacity for strong
attachments, or she wouldn&rsquo;t have abandoned the elegancies,
and comforts, and friends of her former home, to fix contentedly,
in such a wilderness as this, with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She abandoned them under a delusion,&rsquo; he
answered; &lsquo;picturing in me a hero of romance, and expecting
unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion.&nbsp; I can
hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so
obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my
character and acting on the false impressions she
cherished.&nbsp; But, at last, I think she begins to know me: I
don&rsquo;t perceive the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked
me at first; and the senseless incapability of discerning that I
was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her infatuation and
herself.&nbsp; It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to
discover that I did not love her.&nbsp; I believed, at one time,
no lessons could teach her that!&nbsp; And yet it is poorly
learnt; for this morning she announced, as a piece of appalling
intelligence, that I had actually succeeded in making her hate
me!&nbsp; A positive labour of Hercules, I assure you!&nbsp; If
it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks.&nbsp; Can I trust
your assertion, Isabella?&nbsp; Are you sure you hate me?&nbsp;
If I let you alone for half a day, won&rsquo;t you come sighing
and wheedling to me again?&nbsp; I daresay she would rather I had
seemed all tenderness before you: it wounds her vanity to have
the truth exposed.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t care who knows that
the passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie
about it.&nbsp; She cannot accuse me of showing one bit of
deceitful softness.&nbsp; The first thing she saw me do, on
coming out of the Grange, was to hang up her little dog; and when
she pleaded for it, the first words I uttered were a wish that I
had the hanging of every being belonging to her, except one:
possibly she took that exception for herself.&nbsp; But no
brutality disgusted her: I suppose she has an innate admiration
of it, if only her precious person were secure from injury!&nbsp;
Now, was it not the depth of absurdity&mdash;of genuine idiotcy,
for that pitiful, slavish, mean-minded brach to dream that I
could love her?&nbsp; Tell your master, Nelly, that I never, in
all my life, met with such an abject thing as she is.&nbsp; She
even disgraces the name of Linton; and I&rsquo;ve sometimes
relented, from pure lack of invention, in my experiments on what
she could endure, and still creep shamefully cringing back!&nbsp;
But tell him, also, to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at
ease: that I keep strictly within the limits of the law.&nbsp; I
have avoided, up to this period, giving her the slightest right
to claim a separation; and, what&rsquo;s more, she&rsquo;d thank
nobody for dividing us.&nbsp; If she desired to go, she might:
the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification to be
derived from tormenting her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Heathcliff,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;this is the talk
of a madman; your wife, most likely, is convinced you are mad;
and, for that reason, she has borne with you hitherto: but now
that you say she may go, she&rsquo;ll doubtless avail herself of
the permission.&nbsp; You are not so bewitched, ma&rsquo;am, are
you, as to remain with him of your own accord?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care, Ellen!&rsquo; answered Isabella, her eyes
sparkling irefully; there was no misdoubting by their expression
the full success of her partner&rsquo;s endeavours to make
himself detested.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t put faith in a single
word he speaks.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a lying fiend! a monster, and
not a human being!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been told I might leave him
before; and I&rsquo;ve made the attempt, but I dare not repeat
it!&nbsp; Only, Ellen, promise you&rsquo;ll not mention a
syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or
Catherine.&nbsp; Whatever he may pretend, he wishes to provoke
Edgar to desperation: he says he has married me on purpose to
obtain power over him; and he sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t obtain
it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll die first!&nbsp; I just hope, I pray, that he
may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me!&nbsp; The single
pleasure I can imagine is to die, or to see him dead!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&mdash;that will do for the present!&rsquo; said
Heathcliff.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you are called upon in a court of
law, you&rsquo;ll remember her language, Nelly!&nbsp; And take a
good look at that countenance: she&rsquo;s near the point which
would suit me.&nbsp; No; you&rsquo;re not fit to be your own
guardian, Isabella, now; and I, being your legal protector, must
retain you in my custody, however distasteful the obligation may
be.&nbsp; Go up-stairs; I have something to say to Ellen Dean in
private.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not the way: up-stairs, I tell
you!&nbsp; Why, this is the road upstairs, child!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He seized, and thrust her from the room; and returned
muttering&mdash;&lsquo;I have no pity!&nbsp; I have no
pity!&nbsp; The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to crush
out their entrails!&nbsp; It is a moral teething; and I grind
with greater energy in proportion to the increase of
pain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you understand what the word pity means?&rsquo; I
said, hastening to resume my bonnet.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you ever
feel a touch of it in your life?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put that down!&rsquo; he interrupted, perceiving my
intention to depart.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are not going yet.&nbsp;
Come here now, Nelly: I must either persuade or compel you to aid
me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine, and that
without delay.&nbsp; I swear that I meditate no harm: I
don&rsquo;t desire to cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or
insult Mr. Linton; I only wish to hear from herself how she is,
and why she has been ill; and to ask if anything that I could do
would be of use to her.&nbsp; Last night I was in the Grange
garden six hours, and I&rsquo;ll return there to-night; and every
night I&rsquo;ll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an
opportunity of entering.&nbsp; If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall
not hesitate to knock him down, and give him enough to insure his
quiescence while I stay.&nbsp; If his servants oppose me, I shall
threaten them off with these pistols.&nbsp; But wouldn&rsquo;t it
be better to prevent my coming in contact with them, or their
master?&nbsp; And you could do it so easily.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d warn
you when I came, and then you might let me in unobserved, as soon
as she was alone, and watch till I departed, your conscience
quite calm: you would be hindering mischief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I protested against playing that treacherous part in my
employer&rsquo;s house: and, besides, I urged the cruelty and
selfishness of his destroying Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s tranquillity
for his satisfaction.&nbsp; &lsquo;The commonest occurrence
startles her painfully,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s
all nerves, and she couldn&rsquo;t bear the surprise, I&rsquo;m
positive.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t persist, sir! or else I shall be
obliged to inform my master of your designs; and he&rsquo;ll take
measures to secure his house and its inmates from any such
unwarrantable intrusions!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In that case I&rsquo;ll take measures to secure you,
woman!&rsquo; exclaimed Heathcliff; &lsquo;you shall not leave
Wuthering Heights till to-morrow morning.&nbsp; It is a foolish
story to assert that Catherine could not bear to see me; and as
to surprising her, I don&rsquo;t desire it: you must prepare
her&mdash;ask her if I may come.&nbsp; You say she never mentions
my name, and that I am never mentioned to her.&nbsp; To whom
should she mention me if I am a forbidden topic in the
house?&nbsp; She thinks you are all spies for her husband.&nbsp;
Oh, I&rsquo;ve no doubt she&rsquo;s in hell among you!&nbsp; I
guess by her silence, as much as anything, what she feels.&nbsp;
You say she is often restless, and anxious-looking: is that a
proof of tranquillity?&nbsp; You talk of her mind being
unsettled.&nbsp; How the devil could it be otherwise in her
frightful isolation?&nbsp; And that insipid, paltry creature
attending her from <i>duty</i> and <i>humanity</i>!&nbsp; From
<i>pity</i> and <i>charity</i>!&nbsp; He might as well plant an
oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine he can
restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares?&nbsp; Let
us settle it at once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my
way to Catherine over Linton and his footman?&nbsp; Or will you
be my friend, as you have been hitherto, and do what I
request?&nbsp; Decide! because there is no reason for my
lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn
ill-nature!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly
refused him fifty times; but in the long run he forced me to an
agreement.&nbsp; I engaged to carry a letter from him to my
mistress; and should she consent, I promised to let him have
intelligence of Linton&rsquo;s next absence from home, when he
might come, and get in as he was able: I wouldn&rsquo;t be there,
and my fellow-servants should be equally out of the way.&nbsp;
Was it right or wrong?&nbsp; I fear it was wrong, though
expedient.&nbsp; I thought I prevented another explosion by my
compliance; and I thought, too, it might create a favourable
crisis in Catherine&rsquo;s mental illness: and then I remembered
Mr. Edgar&rsquo;s stern rebuke of my carrying tales; and I tried
to smooth away all disquietude on the subject, by affirming, with
frequent iteration, that that betrayal of trust, if it merited so
harsh an appellation, should be the last.&nbsp; Notwithstanding,
my journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither; and many
misgivings I had, ere I could prevail on myself to put the
missive into Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>But here is Kenneth; I&rsquo;ll go down, and tell him how much
better you are.&nbsp; My history is <i>dree</i>, as we say, and
will serve to while away another morning.</p>
<p>Dree, and dreary!&nbsp; I reflected as the good woman
descended to receive the doctor: and not exactly of the kind
which I should have chosen to amuse me.&nbsp; But never
mind!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs.
Dean&rsquo;s bitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the
fascination that lurks in Catherine Heathcliff&rsquo;s brilliant
eyes.&nbsp; I should be in a curious taking if I surrendered my
heart to that young person, and the daughter turned out a second
edition of the mother.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>Another week over&mdash;and I am so many days nearer health,
and spring!&nbsp; I have now heard all my neighbour&rsquo;s
history, at different sittings, as the housekeeper could spare
time from more important occupations.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll continue
it in her own words, only a little condensed.&nbsp; She is, on
the whole, a very fair narrator, and I don&rsquo;t think I could
improve her style.</p>
<p>In the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the
Heights, I knew, as well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was
about the place; and I shunned going out, because I still carried
his letter in my pocket, and didn&rsquo;t want to be threatened
or teased any more.&nbsp; I had made up my mind not to give it
till my master went somewhere, as I could not guess how its
receipt would affect Catherine.&nbsp; The consequence was, that
it did not reach her before the lapse of three days.&nbsp; The
fourth was Sunday, and I brought it into her room after the
family were gone to church.&nbsp; There was a manservant left to
keep the house with me, and we generally made a practice of
locking the doors during the hours of service; but on that
occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that I set them
wide open, and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would be
coming, I told my companion that the mistress wished very much
for some oranges, and he must run over to the village and get a
few, to be paid for on the morrow.&nbsp; He departed, and I went
up-stairs.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl
over her shoulders, in the recess of the open window, as
usual.&nbsp; Her thick, long hair had been partly removed at the
beginning of her illness, and now she wore it simply combed in
its natural tresses over her temples and neck.&nbsp; Her
appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when she
was calm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change.&nbsp; The
flash of her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy
softness; they no longer gave the impression of looking at the
objects around her: they appeared always to gaze beyond, and far
beyond&mdash;you would have said out of this world.&nbsp; Then,
the paleness of her face&mdash;its haggard aspect having vanished
as she recovered flesh&mdash;and the peculiar expression arising
from her mental state, though painfully suggestive of their
causes, added to the touching interest which she awakened;
and&mdash;invariably to me, I know, and to any person who saw
her, I should think&mdash;refuted more tangible proofs of
convalescence, and stamped her as one doomed to decay.</p>
<p>A book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely
perceptible wind fluttered its leaves at intervals.&nbsp; I
believe Linton had laid it there: for she never endeavoured to
divert herself with reading, or occupation of any kind, and he
would spend many an hour in trying to entice her attention to
some subject which had formerly been her amusement.&nbsp; She was
conscious of his aim, and in her better moods endured his efforts
placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and then
suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the
saddest of smiles and kisses.&nbsp; At other times, she would
turn petulantly away, and hide her face in her hands, or even
push him off angrily; and then he took care to let her alone, for
he was certain of doing no good.</p>
<p>Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full,
mellow flow of the beck in the valley came soothingly on the
ear.&nbsp; It was a sweet substitute for the yet absent murmur of
the summer foliage, which drowned that music about the Grange
when the trees were in leaf.&nbsp; At Wuthering Heights it always
sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a season of
steady rain.&nbsp; And of Wuthering Heights Catherine was
thinking as she listened: that is, if she thought or listened at
all; but she had the vague, distant look I mentioned before,
which expressed no recognition of material things either by ear
or eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,&rsquo; I
said, gently inserting it in one hand that rested on her
knee.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must read it immediately, because it wants
an answer.&nbsp; Shall I break the seal?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she answered, without altering the direction
of her eyes.&nbsp; I opened it&mdash;it was very short.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;read it.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
drew away her hand, and let it fall.&nbsp; I replaced it in her
lap, and stood waiting till it should please her to glance down;
but that movement was so long delayed that at last I
resumed&mdash;&lsquo;Must I read it, ma&rsquo;am?&nbsp; It is
from Mr. Heathcliff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a
struggle to arrange her ideas.&nbsp; She lifted the letter, and
seemed to peruse it; and when she came to the signature she
sighed: yet still I found she had not gathered its import, for,
upon my desiring to hear her reply, she merely pointed to the
name, and gazed at me with mournful and questioning
eagerness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he wishes to see you,&rsquo; said I, guessing her
need of an interpreter.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s in the garden by
this time, and impatient to know what answer I shall
bring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass
beneath raise its ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing
them back, announce, by a wag of the tail, that some one
approached whom it did not consider a stranger.&nbsp; Mrs. Linton
bent forward, and listened breathlessly.&nbsp; The minute after a
step traversed the hall; the open house was too tempting for
Heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely he supposed that I
was inclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to trust to his
own audacity.&nbsp; With straining eagerness Catherine gazed
towards the entrance of her chamber.&nbsp; He did not hit the
right room directly: she motioned me to admit him, but he found
it out ere I could reach the door, and in a stride or two was at
her side, and had her grasped in his arms.</p>
<p>He neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes,
during which period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in
his life before, I daresay: but then my mistress had kissed him
first, and I plainly saw that he could hardly bear, for downright
agony, to look into her face!&nbsp; The same conviction had
stricken him as me, from the instant he beheld her, that there
was no prospect of ultimate recovery there&mdash;she was fated,
sure to die.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Cathy!&nbsp; Oh, my life! how can I bear it?&rsquo;
was the first sentence he uttered, in a tone that did not seek to
disguise his despair.&nbsp; And now he stared at her so earnestly
that I thought the very intensity of his gaze would bring tears
into his eyes; but they burned with anguish: they did not
melt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What now?&rsquo; said Catherine, leaning back, and
returning his look with a suddenly clouded brow: her humour was a
mere vane for constantly varying caprices.&nbsp; &lsquo;You and
Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff!&nbsp; And you both come
to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be
pitied!&nbsp; I shall not pity you, not I.&nbsp; You have killed
me&mdash;and thriven on it, I think.&nbsp; How strong you
are!&nbsp; How many years do you mean to live after I am
gone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her; he attempted
to rise, but she seized his hair, and kept him down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could hold you,&rsquo; she continued,
bitterly, &lsquo;till we were both dead!&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t
care what you suffered.&nbsp; I care nothing for your
sufferings.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t you suffer?&nbsp; I
do!&nbsp; Will you forget me?&nbsp; Will you be happy when I am
in the earth?&nbsp; Will you say twenty years hence,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the grave of Catherine Earnshaw?&nbsp; I
loved her long ago, and was wretched to lose her; but it is
past.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve loved many others since: my children are
dearer to me than she was; and, at death, I shall not rejoice
that I am going to her: I shall be sorry that I must leave
them!&rdquo;&nbsp; Will you say so, Heathcliff?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t torture me till I&rsquo;m as mad as
yourself,&rsquo; cried he, wrenching his head free, and grinding
his teeth.</p>
<p>The two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful
picture.&nbsp; Well might Catherine deem that heaven would be a
land of exile to her, unless with her mortal body she cast away
her moral character also.&nbsp; Her present countenance had a
wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a bloodless lip and
scintillating eye; and she retained in her closed fingers a
portion of the locks she had been grasping.&nbsp; As to her
companion, while raising himself with one hand, he had taken her
arm with the other; and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness
to the requirements of her condition, that on his letting go I
saw four distinct impressions left blue in the colourless
skin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you possessed with a devil,&rsquo; he pursued,
savagely, &lsquo;to talk in that manner to me when you are
dying?&nbsp; Do you reflect that all those words will be branded
in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after you have left
me?&nbsp; You know you lie to say I have killed you: and,
Catherine, you know that I could as soon forget you as my
existence!&nbsp; Is it not sufficient for your infernal
selfishness, that while you are at peace I shall writhe in the
torments of hell?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not be at peace,&rsquo; moaned Catherine,
recalled to a sense of physical weakness by the violent, unequal
throbbing of her heart, which beat visibly and audibly under this
excess of agitation.&nbsp; She said nothing further till the
paroxysm was over; then she continued, more kindly&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not wishing you greater torment than I have,
Heathcliff.&nbsp; I only wish us never to be parted: and should a
word of mine distress you hereafter, think I feel the same
distress underground, and for my own sake, forgive me!&nbsp; Come
here and kneel down again!&nbsp; You never harmed me in your
life.&nbsp; Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to
remember than my harsh words!&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you come here
again?&nbsp; Do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but
not so far as to let her see his face, which was livid with
emotion.&nbsp; She bent round to look at him; he would not permit
it: turning abruptly, he walked to the fireplace, where he stood,
silent, with his back towards us.&nbsp; Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s
glance followed him suspiciously: every movement woke a new
sentiment in her.&nbsp; After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she
resumed; addressing me in accents of indignant
disappointment:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to
keep me out of the grave.&nbsp; <i>That</i> is how I&rsquo;m
loved!&nbsp; Well, never mind.&nbsp; That is not <i>my</i>
Heathcliff.&nbsp; I shall love mine yet; and take him with me:
he&rsquo;s in my soul.&nbsp; And,&rsquo; added she musingly,
&lsquo;the thing that irks me most is this shattered prison,
after all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m tired of being enclosed here.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be
always there: not seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for
it through the walls of an aching heart: but really with it, and
in it.&nbsp; Nelly, you think you are better and more fortunate
than I; in full health and strength: you are sorry for
me&mdash;very soon that will be altered.&nbsp; I shall be sorry
for <i>you</i>.&nbsp; I shall be incomparably beyond and above
you all.&nbsp; I <i>wonder</i> he won&rsquo;t be near
me!&rsquo;&nbsp; She went on to herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought
he wished it.&nbsp; Heathcliff, dear! you should not be sullen
now.&nbsp; Do come to me, Heathcliff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of
the chair.&nbsp; At that earnest appeal he turned to her, looking
absolutely desperate.&nbsp; His eyes, wide and wet, at last
flashed fiercely on her; his breast heaved convulsively.&nbsp; An
instant they held asunder, and then how they met I hardly saw,
but Catherine made a spring, and he caught her, and they were
locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress would never
be released alive: in fact, to my eyes, she seemed directly
insensible.&nbsp; He flung himself into the nearest seat, and on
my approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted, he
gnashed at me, and foamed like a mad dog, and gathered her to him
with greedy jealousy.&nbsp; I did not feel as if I were in the
company of a creature of my own species: it appeared that he
would not understand, though I spoke to him; so I stood off, and
held my tongue, in great perplexity.</p>
<p>A movement of Catherine&rsquo;s relieved me a little
presently: she put up her hand to clasp his neck, and bring her
cheek to his as he held her; while he, in return, covering her
with frantic caresses, said wildly&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You teach me now how cruel you&rsquo;ve
been&mdash;cruel and false.&nbsp; <i>Why</i> did you despise
me?&nbsp; <i>Why</i> did you betray your own heart, Cathy?&nbsp;
I have not one word of comfort.&nbsp; You deserve this.&nbsp; You
have killed yourself.&nbsp; Yes, you may kiss me, and cry; and
wring out my kisses and tears: they&rsquo;ll blight
you&mdash;they&rsquo;ll damn you.&nbsp; You loved me&mdash;then
what <i>right</i> had you to leave me?&nbsp; What
right&mdash;answer me&mdash;for the poor fancy you felt for
Linton?&nbsp; Because misery and degradation, and death, and
nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us,
<i>you</i>, of your own will, did it.&nbsp; I have not broken
your heart&mdash;<i>you</i> have broken it; and in breaking it,
you have broken mine.&nbsp; So much the worse for me that I am
strong.&nbsp; Do I want to live?&nbsp; What kind of living will
it be when you&mdash;oh, God! would <i>you</i> like to live with
your soul in the grave?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me alone.&nbsp; Let me alone,&rsquo; sobbed
Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I&rsquo;ve done wrong, I&rsquo;m dying
for it.&nbsp; It is enough!&nbsp; You left me too: but I
won&rsquo;t upbraid you!&nbsp; I forgive you.&nbsp; Forgive
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and
feel those wasted hands,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Kiss me
again; and don&rsquo;t let me see your eyes!&nbsp; I forgive what
you have done to me.&nbsp; I love <i>my</i> murderer&mdash;but
<i>yours</i>!&nbsp; How can I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were silent&mdash;their faces hid against each other, and
washed by each other&rsquo;s tears.&nbsp; At least, I suppose the
weeping was on both sides; as it seemed Heathcliff could weep on
a great occasion like this.</p>
<p>I grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore
fast away, the man whom I had sent off returned from his errand,
and I could distinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the
valley, a concourse thickening outside Gimmerton chapel
porch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Service is over,&rsquo; I announced.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
master will be here in half an hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff groaned a curse, and strained Catherine closer: she
never moved.</p>
<p>Ere long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the
road towards the kitchen wing.&nbsp; Mr. Linton was not far
behind; he opened the gate himself and sauntered slowly up,
probably enjoying the lovely afternoon that breathed as soft as
summer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now he is here,&rsquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;For
heaven&rsquo;s sake, hurry down!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll not meet any
one on the front stairs.&nbsp; Do be quick; and stay among the
trees till he is fairly in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must go, Cathy,&rsquo; said Heathcliff, seeking to
extricate himself from his companion&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But if I live, I&rsquo;ll see you again before you are
asleep.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t stray five yards from your
window.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not go!&rsquo; she answered, holding him as
firmly as her strength allowed.&nbsp; &lsquo;You <i>shall</i>
not, I tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For one hour,&rsquo; he pleaded earnestly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not for one minute,&rsquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I <i>must</i>&mdash;Linton will be up
immediately,&rsquo; persisted the alarmed intruder.</p>
<p>He would have risen, and unfixed her fingers by the
act&mdash;she clung fast, gasping: there was mad resolution in
her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; she shrieked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t,
don&rsquo;t go.&nbsp; It is the last time!&nbsp; Edgar will not
hurt us.&nbsp; Heathcliff, I shall die!&nbsp; I shall
die!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damn the fool!&nbsp; There he is,&rsquo; cried
Heathcliff, sinking back into his seat.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hush, my
darling!&nbsp; Hush, hush, Catherine!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
stay.&nbsp; If he shot me so, I&rsquo;d expire with a blessing on
my lips.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And there they were fast again.&nbsp; I heard my master
mounting the stairs&mdash;the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I
was horrified.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you going to listen to her ravings?&rsquo; I said,
passionately.&nbsp; &lsquo;She does not know what she says.&nbsp;
Will you ruin her, because she has not wit to help herself?&nbsp;
Get up!&nbsp; You could be free instantly.&nbsp; That is the most
diabolical deed that ever you did.&nbsp; We are all done
for&mdash;master, mistress, and servant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I wrung my hands, and cried out; and Mr. Linton hastened his
step at the noise.&nbsp; In the midst of my agitation, I was
sincerely glad to observe that Catherine&rsquo;s arms had fallen
relaxed, and her head hung down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s fainted, or dead,&rsquo; I thought:
&lsquo;so much the better.&nbsp; Far better that she should be
dead, than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to all about
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Edgar sprang to his unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment
and rage.&nbsp; What he meant to do I cannot tell; however, the
other stopped all demonstrations, at once, by placing the
lifeless-looking form in his arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look there!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Unless you be
a fiend, help her first&mdash;then you shall speak to
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He walked into the parlour, and sat down.&nbsp; Mr. Linton
summoned me, and with great difficulty, and after resorting to
many means, we managed to restore her to sensation; but she was
all bewildered; she sighed, and moaned, and knew nobody.&nbsp;
Edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her hated friend.&nbsp; I
did not.&nbsp; I went, at the earliest opportunity, and besought
him to depart; affirming that Catherine was better, and he should
hear from me in the morning how she passed the night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not refuse to go out of doors,&rsquo; he
answered; &lsquo;but I shall stay in the garden: and, Nelly, mind
you keep your word to-morrow.&nbsp; I shall be under those
larch-trees.&nbsp; Mind! or I pay another visit, whether Linton
be in or not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He sent a rapid glance through the half-open door of the
chamber, and, ascertaining that what I stated was apparently
true, delivered the house of his luckless presence.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>About twelve o&rsquo;clock that night was born the Catherine
you saw at Wuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months&rsquo; child;
and two hours after the mother died, having never recovered
sufficient consciousness to miss Heathcliff, or know Edgar.&nbsp;
The latter&rsquo;s distraction at his bereavement is a subject
too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how deep the
sorrow sunk.&nbsp; A great addition, in my eyes, was his being
left without an heir.&nbsp; I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the
feeble orphan; and I mentally abused old Linton for (what was
only natural partiality) the securing his estate to his own
daughter, instead of his son&rsquo;s.&nbsp; An unwelcomed infant
it was, poor thing!&nbsp; It might have wailed out of life, and
nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of
existence.&nbsp; We redeemed the neglect afterwards; but its
beginning was as friendless as its end is likely to be.</p>
<p>Next morning&mdash;bright and cheerful out of
doors&mdash;stole softened in through the blinds of the silent
room, and suffused the couch and its occupant with a mellow,
tender glow.&nbsp; Edgar Linton had his head laid on the pillow,
and his eyes shut.&nbsp; His young and fair features were almost
as deathlike as those of the form beside him, and almost as
fixed: but <i>his</i> was the hush of exhausted anguish, and
<i>hers</i> of perfect peace.&nbsp; Her brow smooth, her lids
closed, her lips wearing the expression of a smile; no angel in
heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared.&nbsp; And I
partook of the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never
in a holier frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of
Divine rest.&nbsp; I instinctively echoed the words she had
uttered a few hours before: &lsquo;Incomparably beyond and above
us all!&nbsp; Whether still on earth or now in heaven, her spirit
is at home with God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am
seldom otherwise than happy while watching in the chamber of
death, should no frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty
with me.&nbsp; I see a repose that neither earth nor hell can
break, and I feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless
hereafter&mdash;the Eternity they have entered&mdash;where life
is boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy
in its fulness.&nbsp; I noticed on that occasion how much
selfishness there is even in a love like Mr. Linton&rsquo;s, when
he so regretted Catherine&rsquo;s blessed release!&nbsp; To be
sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward and impatient
existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of peace at
last.&nbsp; One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but
not then, in the presence of her corpse.&nbsp; It asserted its
own tranquillity, which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its
former inhabitant.</p>
<p>Do you believe such people are happy in the other world,
sir?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d give a great deal to know.</p>
<p>I declined answering Mrs. Dean&rsquo;s question, which struck
me as something heterodox.&nbsp; She proceeded:</p>
<p>Retracing the course of Catherine Linton, I fear we have no
right to think she is; but we&rsquo;ll leave her with her
Maker.</p>
<p>The master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to
quit the room and steal out to the pure refreshing air.&nbsp; The
servants thought me gone to shake off the drowsiness of my
protracted watch; in reality, my chief motive was seeing Mr.
Heathcliff.&nbsp; If he had remained among the larches all night,
he would have heard nothing of the stir at the Grange; unless,
perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to
Gimmerton.&nbsp; If he had come nearer, he would probably be
aware, from the lights flitting to and fro, and the opening and
shutting of the outer doors, that all was not right within.&nbsp;
I wished, yet feared, to find him.&nbsp; I felt the terrible news
must be told, and I longed to get it over; but how to do it I did
not know.&nbsp; He was there&mdash;at least, a few yards further
in the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his hat off, and his
hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded
branches, and fell pattering round him.&nbsp; He had been
standing a long time in that position, for I saw a pair of ousels
passing and repassing scarcely three feet from him, busy in
building their nest, and regarding his proximity no more than
that of a piece of timber.&nbsp; They flew off at my approach,
and he raised his eyes and spoke:&mdash;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s
dead!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve not waited for you to
learn that.&nbsp; Put your handkerchief away&mdash;don&rsquo;t
snivel before me.&nbsp; Damn you all! she wants none of your
tears!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was weeping as much for him as her: we do sometimes pity
creatures that have none of the feeling either for themselves or
others.&nbsp; When I first looked into his face, I perceived that
he had got intelligence of the catastrophe; and a foolish notion
struck me that his heart was quelled and he prayed, because his
lips moved and his gaze was bent on the ground.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s dead!&rsquo; I answered, checking my
sobs and drying my cheeks.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gone to heaven, I hope;
where we may, every one, join her, if we take due warning and
leave our evil ways to follow good!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did <i>she</i> take due warning, then?&rsquo; asked
Heathcliff, attempting a sneer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did she die like a
saint?&nbsp; Come, give me a true history of the event.&nbsp; How
did&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it;
and compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward
agony, defying, meanwhile, my sympathy with an unflinching,
ferocious stare.&nbsp; &lsquo;How did she die?&rsquo; he resumed,
at last&mdash;fain, notwithstanding his hardihood, to have a
support behind him; for, after the struggle, he trembled, in
spite of himself, to his very finger-ends.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor wretch!&rsquo; I thought; &lsquo;you have a heart
and nerves the same as your brother men!&nbsp; Why should you be
anxious to conceal them?&nbsp; Your pride cannot blind God!&nbsp;
You tempt him to wring them, till he forces a cry of
humiliation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quietly as a lamb!&rsquo; I answered, aloud.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She drew a sigh, and stretched herself, like a child
reviving, and sinking again to sleep; and five minutes after I
felt one little pulse at her heart, and nothing more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And&mdash;did she ever mention me?&rsquo; he asked,
hesitating, as if he dreaded the answer to his question would
introduce details that he could not bear to hear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her senses never returned: she recognised nobody from
the time you left her,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;She lies with
a sweet smile on her face; and her latest ideas wandered back to
pleasant early days.&nbsp; Her life closed in a gentle
dream&mdash;may she wake as kindly in the other world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May she wake in torment!&rsquo; he cried, with
frightful vehemence, stamping his foot, and groaning in a sudden
paroxysm of ungovernable passion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, she&rsquo;s a
liar to the end!&nbsp; Where is she?&nbsp; Not
<i>there</i>&mdash;not in heaven&mdash;not
perished&mdash;where?&nbsp; Oh! you said you cared nothing for my
sufferings!&nbsp; And I pray one prayer&mdash;I repeat it till my
tongue stiffens&mdash;Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as
long as I am living; you said I killed you&mdash;haunt me,
then!&nbsp; The murdered <i>do</i> haunt their murderers, I
believe.&nbsp; I know that ghosts <i>have</i> wandered on
earth.&nbsp; Be with me always&mdash;take any form&mdash;drive me
mad! only <i>do</i> not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot
find you!&nbsp; Oh, God! it is unutterable!&nbsp; I <i>cannot</i>
live without my life!&nbsp; I <i>cannot</i> live without my
soul!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up
his eyes, howled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being
goaded to death with knives and spears.&nbsp; I observed several
splashes of blood about the bark of the tree, and his hand and
forehead were both stained; probably the scene I witnessed was a
repetition of others acted during the night.&nbsp; It hardly
moved my compassion&mdash;it appalled me: still, I felt reluctant
to quit him so.&nbsp; But the moment he recollected himself
enough to notice me watching, he thundered a command for me to
go, and I obeyed.&nbsp; He was beyond my skill to quiet or
console!</p>
<p>Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s funeral was appointed to take place on the
Friday following her decease; and till then her coffin remained
uncovered, and strewn with flowers and scented leaves, in the
great drawing-room.&nbsp; Linton spent his days and nights there,
a sleepless guardian; and&mdash;a circumstance concealed from all
but me&mdash;Heathcliff spent his nights, at least, outside,
equally a stranger to repose.&nbsp; I held no communication with
him: still, I was conscious of his design to enter, if he could;
and on the Tuesday, a little after dark, when my master, from
sheer fatigue, had been compelled to retire a couple of hours, I
went and opened one of the windows; moved by his perseverance to
give him a chance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one
final adieu.&nbsp; He did not omit to avail himself of the
opportunity, cautiously and briefly; too cautiously to betray his
presence by the slightest noise.&nbsp; Indeed, I shouldn&rsquo;t
have discovered that he had been there, except for the
disarrangement of the drapery about the corpse&rsquo;s face, and
for observing on the floor a curl of light hair, fastened with a
silver thread; which, on examination, I ascertained to have been
taken from a locket hung round Catherine&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp;
Heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents,
replacing them by a black lock of his own.&nbsp; I twisted the
two, and enclosed them together.</p>
<p>Mr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of
his sister to the grave; he sent no excuse, but he never came; so
that, besides her husband, the mourners were wholly composed of
tenants and servants.&nbsp; Isabella was not asked.</p>
<p>The place of Catherine&rsquo;s interment, to the surprise of
the villagers, was neither in the chapel under the carved
monument of the Lintons, nor yet by the tombs of her own
relations, outside.&nbsp; It was dug on a green slope in a corner
of the kirk-yard, where the wall is so low that heath and
bilberry-plants have climbed over it from the moor; and
peat-mould almost buries it.&nbsp; Her husband lies in the same
spot now; and they have each a simple headstone above, and a
plain grey block at their feet, to mark the graves.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p>That Friday made the last of our fine days for a month.&nbsp;
In the evening the weather broke: the wind shifted from south to
north-east, and brought rain first, and then sleet and
snow.&nbsp; On the morrow one could hardly imagine that there had
been three weeks of summer: the primroses and crocuses were
hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent, the young
leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened.&nbsp; And
dreary, and chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over!&nbsp;
My master kept his room; I took possession of the lonely parlour,
converting it into a nursery: and there I was, sitting with the
moaning doll of a child laid on my knee; rocking it to and fro,
and watching, meanwhile, the still driving flakes build up the
uncurtained window, when the door opened, and some person
entered, out of breath and laughing!&nbsp; My anger was greater
than my astonishment for a minute.&nbsp; I supposed it one of the
maids, and I cried&mdash;&lsquo;Have done!&nbsp; How dare you
show your giddiness here; What would Mr. Linton say if he heard
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excuse me!&rsquo; answered a familiar voice; &lsquo;but
I know Edgar is in bed, and I cannot stop myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and
holding her hand to her side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!&rsquo;
she continued, after a pause; &lsquo;except where I&rsquo;ve
flown.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t count the number of falls
I&rsquo;ve had.&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m aching all over!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t be alarmed!&nbsp; There shall be an explanation as
soon as I can give it; only just have the goodness to step out
and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a
servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff.&nbsp; She certainly seemed
in no laughing predicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders,
dripping with snow and water; she was dressed in the girlish
dress she commonly wore, befitting her age more than her
position: a low frock with short sleeves, and nothing on either
head or neck.&nbsp; The frock was of light silk, and clung to her
with wet, and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers;
add to this a deep cut under one ear, which only the cold
prevented from bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and
bruised, and a frame hardly able to support itself through
fatigue; and you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed
when I had had leisure to examine her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear young lady,&rsquo; I exclaimed,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll stir nowhere, and hear nothing, till you have
removed every article of your clothes, and put on dry things; and
certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton to-night, so it is
needless to order the carriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly I shall,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;walking or
riding: yet I&rsquo;ve no objection to dress myself
decently.&nbsp; And&mdash;ah, see how it flows down my neck
now!&nbsp; The fire does make it smart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She insisted on my fulfilling her directions, before she would
let me touch her; and not till after the coachman had been
instructed to get ready, and a maid set to pack up some necessary
attire, did I obtain her consent for binding the wound and
helping to change her garments.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Ellen,&rsquo; she said, when my task was finished
and she was seated in an easy-chair on the hearth, with a cup of
tea before her, &lsquo;you sit down opposite me, and put poor
Catherine&rsquo;s baby away: I don&rsquo;t like to see it!&nbsp;
You mustn&rsquo;t think I care little for Catherine, because I
behaved so foolishly on entering: I&rsquo;ve cried, too,
bitterly&mdash;yes, more than any one else has reason to
cry.&nbsp; We parted unreconciled, you remember, and I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t forgive myself.&nbsp; But, for all that, I
was not going to sympathise with him&mdash;the brute beast!&nbsp;
Oh, give me the poker!&nbsp; This is the last thing of his I have
about me:&rsquo; she slipped the gold ring from her third finger,
and threw it on the floor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll smash
it!&rsquo; she continued, striking it with childish spite,
&lsquo;and then I&rsquo;ll burn it!&rsquo; and she took and
dropped the misused article among the coals.&nbsp; &lsquo;There!
he shall buy another, if he gets me back again.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d
be capable of coming to seek me, to tease Edgar.&nbsp; I dare not
stay, lest that notion should possess his wicked head!&nbsp; And
besides, Edgar has not been kind, has he?&nbsp; And I won&rsquo;t
come suing for his assistance; nor will I bring him into more
trouble.&nbsp; Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here;
though, if I had not learned he was out of the way, I&rsquo;d
have halted at the kitchen, washed my face, warmed myself, got
you to bring what I wanted, and departed again to anywhere out of
the reach of my accursed&mdash;of that incarnate goblin!&nbsp;
Ah, he was in such a fury!&nbsp; If he had caught me!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a pity Earnshaw is not his match in strength: I
wouldn&rsquo;t have run till I&rsquo;d seen him all but
demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, don&rsquo;t talk so fast, Miss!&rsquo; I
interrupted; &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll disorder the handkerchief I have
tied round your face, and make the cut bleed again.&nbsp; Drink
your tea, and take breath, and give over laughing: laughter is
sadly out of place under this roof, and in your
condition!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An undeniable truth,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Listen to that child!&nbsp; It maintains a constant
wail&mdash;send it out of my hearing for an hour; I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stay any longer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I rang the bell, and committed it to a servant&rsquo;s care;
and then I inquired what had urged her to escape from Wuthering
Heights in such an unlikely plight, and where she meant to go, as
she refused remaining with us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ought, and I wished to remain,&rsquo; answered she,
&lsquo;to cheer Edgar and take care of the baby, for two things,
and because the Grange is my right home.&nbsp; But I tell you he
wouldn&rsquo;t let me!&nbsp; Do you think he could bear to see me
grow fat and merry&mdash;could bear to think that we were
tranquil, and not resolve on poisoning our comfort?&nbsp; Now, I
have the satisfaction of being sure that he detests me, to the
point of its annoying him seriously to have me within ear-shot or
eyesight: I notice, when I enter his presence, the muscles of his
countenance are involuntarily distorted into an expression of
hatred; partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes I
have to feel that sentiment for him, and partly from original
aversion.&nbsp; It is strong enough to make me feel pretty
certain that he would not chase me over England, supposing I
contrived a clear escape; and therefore I must get quite
away.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve recovered from my first desire to be
killed by him: I&rsquo;d rather he&rsquo;d kill himself!&nbsp; He
has extinguished my love effectually, and so I&rsquo;m at my
ease.&nbsp; I can recollect yet how I loved him; and can dimly
imagine that I could still be loving him, if&mdash;no, no!&nbsp;
Even if he had doted on me, the devilish nature would have
revealed its existence somehow.&nbsp; Catherine had an awfully
perverted taste to esteem him so dearly, knowing him so
well.&nbsp; Monster! would that he could be blotted out of
creation, and out of my memory!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, hush!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a human being,&rsquo; I
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be more charitable: there are worse men than
he is yet!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not a human being,&rsquo; she retorted;
&lsquo;and he has no claim on my charity.&nbsp; I gave him my
heart, and he took and pinched it to death, and flung it back to
me.&nbsp; People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and since he has
destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him: and I would
not, though he groaned from this to his dying day, and wept tears
of blood for Catherine!&nbsp; No, indeed, indeed, I
wouldn&rsquo;t!&rsquo;&nbsp; And here Isabella began to cry; but,
immediately dashing the water from her lashes, she
recommenced.&nbsp; &lsquo;You asked, what has driven me to flight
at last?&nbsp; I was compelled to attempt it, because I had
succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity.&nbsp;
Pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers requires more
coolness than knocking on the head.&nbsp; He was worked up to
forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of, and proceeded to
murderous violence.&nbsp; I experienced pleasure in being able to
exasperate him: the sense of pleasure woke my instinct of
self-preservation, so I fairly broke free; and if ever I come
into his hands again he is welcome to a signal revenge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been at
the funeral.&nbsp; He kept himself sober for the
purpose&mdash;tolerably sober: not going to bed mad at six
o&rsquo;clock and getting up drunk at twelve.&nbsp; Consequently,
he rose, in suicidal low spirits, as fit for the church as for a
dance; and instead, he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or
brandy by tumblerfuls.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heathcliff&mdash;I shudder to name him! has been a
stranger in the house from last Sunday till to-day.&nbsp; Whether
the angels have fed him, or his kin beneath, I cannot tell; but
he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a week.&nbsp; He has
just come home at dawn, and gone up-stairs to his chamber;
locking himself in&mdash;as if anybody dreamt of coveting his
company!&nbsp; There he has continued, praying like a Methodist:
only the deity he implored is senseless dust and ashes; and God,
when addressed, was curiously confounded with his own black
father!&nbsp; After concluding these precious orisons&mdash;and
they lasted generally till he grew hoarse and his voice was
strangled in his throat&mdash;he would be off again; always
straight down to the Grange!&nbsp; I wonder Edgar did not send
for a constable, and give him into custody!&nbsp; For me, grieved
as I was about Catherine, it was impossible to avoid regarding
this season of deliverance from degrading oppression as a
holiday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I recovered spirits sufficient to bear Joseph&rsquo;s
eternal lectures without weeping, and to move up and down the
house less with the foot of a frightened thief than
formerly.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t think that I should cry at
anything Joseph could say; but he and Hareton are detestable
companions.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather sit with Hindley, and hear his
awful talk, than with &ldquo;t&rsquo; little maister&rdquo; and
his staunch supporter, that odious old man!&nbsp; When Heathcliff
is in, I&rsquo;m often obliged to seek the kitchen and their
society, or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers; when he
is not, as was the case this week, I establish a table and chair
at one corner of the house fire, and never mind how Mr. Earnshaw
may occupy himself; and he does not interfere with my
arrangements.&nbsp; He is quieter now than he used to be, if no
one provokes him: more sullen and depressed, and less
furious.&nbsp; Joseph affirms he&rsquo;s sure he&rsquo;s an
altered man: that the Lord has touched his heart, and he is saved
&ldquo;so as by fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m puzzled to detect
signs of the favourable change: but it is not my business.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books
till late on towards twelve.&nbsp; It seemed so dismal to go
up-stairs, with the wild snow blowing outside, and my thoughts
continually reverting to the kirk-yard and the new-made
grave!&nbsp; I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before me,
that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place.&nbsp;
Hindley sat opposite, his head leant on his hand; perhaps
meditating on the same subject.&nbsp; He had ceased drinking at a
point below irrationality, and had neither stirred nor spoken
during two or three hours.&nbsp; There was no sound through the
house but the moaning wind, which shook the windows every now and
then, the faint crackling of the coals, and the click of my
snuffers as I removed at intervals the long wick of the
candle.&nbsp; Hareton and Joseph were probably fast asleep in
bed.&nbsp; It was very, very sad: and while I read I sighed, for
it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the world, never to be
restored.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound
of the kitchen latch: Heathcliff had returned from his watch
earlier than usual; owing, I suppose, to the sudden storm.&nbsp;
That entrance was fastened, and we heard him coming round to get
in by the other.&nbsp; I rose with an irrepressible expression of
what I felt on my lips, which induced my companion, who had been
staring towards the door, to turn and look at me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep him out five minutes,&rdquo; he
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t object?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No, you may keep him out the whole night for
me,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do! put the key in the lock,
and draw the bolts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the
front; he then came and brought his chair to the other side of my
table, leaning over it, and searching in my eyes for a sympathy
with the burning hate that gleamed from his: as he both looked
and felt like an assassin, he couldn&rsquo;t exactly find that;
but he discovered enough to encourage him to speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You, and I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have each a
great debt to settle with the man out yonder!&nbsp; If we were
neither of us cowards, we might combine to discharge it.&nbsp;
Are you as soft as your brother?&nbsp; Are you willing to endure
to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m weary of enduring now,&rdquo; I
replied; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d be glad of a retaliation that
wouldn&rsquo;t recoil on myself; but treachery and violence are
spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them
worse than their enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Treachery and violence are a just return for
treachery and violence!&rdquo; cried Hindley.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs.
Heathcliff, I&rsquo;ll ask you to do nothing; but sit still and
be dumb.&nbsp; Tell me now, can you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you
would have as much pleasure as I in witnessing the conclusion of
the fiend&rsquo;s existence; he&rsquo;ll be <i>your</i> death
unless you overreach him; and he&rsquo;ll be <i>my</i>
ruin.&nbsp; Damn the hellish villain!&nbsp; He knocks at the door
as if he were master here already!&nbsp; Promise to hold your
tongue, and before that clock strikes&mdash;it wants three
minutes of one&mdash;you&rsquo;re a free woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He took the implements which I described to you in my
letter from his breast, and would have turned down the
candle.&nbsp; I snatched it away, however, and seized his
arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not hold my tongue!&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t touch him.&nbsp; Let the door remain
shut, and be quiet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve formed my resolution, and
by God I&rsquo;ll execute it!&rdquo; cried the desperate
being.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do you a kindness in spite of
yourself, and Hareton justice!&nbsp; And you needn&rsquo;t
trouble your head to screen me; Catherine is gone.&nbsp; Nobody
alive would regret me, or be ashamed, though I cut my throat this
minute&mdash;and it&rsquo;s time to make an end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I might as well have struggled with a bear, or reasoned
with a lunatic.&nbsp; The only resource left me was to run to a
lattice and warn his intended victim of the fate which awaited
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better seek shelter somewhere else
to-night!&rdquo; I exclaimed, in rather a triumphant tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Earnshaw has a mind to shoot you, if you persist in
endeavouring to enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better open the door,
you&mdash;&rdquo; he answered, addressing me by some elegant term
that I don&rsquo;t care to repeat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I shall not meddle in the matter,&rdquo; I
retorted again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come in and get shot, if you
please.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve done my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With that I shut the window and returned to my place by
the fire; having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to
pretend any anxiety for the danger that menaced him.&nbsp;
Earnshaw swore passionately at me: affirming that I loved the
villain yet; and calling me all sorts of names for the base
spirit I evinced.&nbsp; And I, in my secret heart (and conscience
never reproached me), thought what a blessing it would be for
<i>him</i> should Heathcliff put him out of misery; and what a
blessing for <i>me</i> should he send Heathcliff to his right
abode!&nbsp; As I sat nursing these reflections, the casement
behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow from the latter
individual, and his black countenance looked blightingly
through.&nbsp; The stanchions stood too close to suffer his
shoulders to follow, and I smiled, exulting in my fancied
security.&nbsp; His hair and clothes were whitened with snow, and
his sharp cannibal teeth, revealed by cold and wrath, gleamed
through the dark.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Isabella, let me in, or I&rsquo;ll make you
repent!&rdquo; he &ldquo;girned,&rdquo; as Joseph calls it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I cannot commit murder,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Hindley stands sentinel with a knife and loaded
pistol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Let me in by the kitchen door,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hindley will be there before me,&rdquo; I
answered: &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s a poor love of yours that
cannot bear a shower of snow!&nbsp; We were left at peace in our
beds as long as the summer moon shone, but the moment a blast of
winter returns, you must run for shelter!&nbsp; Heathcliff, if I
were you, I&rsquo;d go stretch myself over her grave and die like
a faithful dog.&nbsp; The world is surely not worth living in
now, is it?&nbsp; You had distinctly impressed on me the idea
that Catherine was the whole joy of your life: I can&rsquo;t
imagine how you think of surviving her loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s there, is he?&rdquo; exclaimed my
companion, rushing to the gap.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I can get my arm
out I can hit him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Ellen, you&rsquo;ll set me down as
really wicked; but you don&rsquo;t know all, so don&rsquo;t
judge.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have aided or abetted an attempt on
even <i>his</i> life for anything.&nbsp; Wish that he were dead,
I must; and therefore I was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved
by terror for the consequences of my taunting speech, when he
flung himself on Earnshaw&rsquo;s weapon and wrenched it from his
grasp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The charge exploded, and the knife, in springing back,
closed into its owner&rsquo;s wrist.&nbsp; Heathcliff pulled it
away by main force, slitting up the flesh as it passed on, and
thrust it dripping into his pocket.&nbsp; He then took a stone,
struck down the division between two windows, and sprang
in.&nbsp; His adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain
and the flow of blood, that gushed from an artery or a large
vein.&nbsp; The ruffian kicked and trampled on him, and dashed
his head repeatedly against the flags, holding me with one hand,
meantime, to prevent me summoning Joseph.&nbsp; He exerted
preterhuman self-denial in abstaining from finishing him
completely; but getting out of breath, he finally desisted, and
dragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle.&nbsp;
There he tore off the sleeve of Earnshaw&rsquo;s coat, and bound
up the wound with brutal roughness; spitting and cursing during
the operation as energetically as he had kicked before.&nbsp;
Being at liberty, I lost no time in seeking the old servant; who,
having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale, hurried
below, gasping, as he descended the steps two at once.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What is ther to do, now? what is ther to do,
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this to do,&rdquo; thundered
Heathcliff, &ldquo;that your master&rsquo;s mad; and should he
last another month, I&rsquo;ll have him to an asylum.&nbsp; And
how the devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless
hound?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stand muttering and mumbling
there.&nbsp; Come, I&rsquo;m not going to nurse him.&nbsp; Wash
that stuff away; and mind the sparks of your candle&mdash;it is
more than half brandy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And so ye&rsquo;ve been murthering on
him?&rdquo; exclaimed Joseph, lifting his hands and eyes in
horror.&nbsp; &ldquo;If iver I seed a seeght loike this!&nbsp;
May the Lord&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the
middle of the blood, and flung a towel to him; but instead of
proceeding to dry it up, he joined his hands and began a prayer,
which excited my laughter from its odd phraseology.&nbsp; I was
in the condition of mind to be shocked at nothing: in fact, I was
as reckless as some malefactors show themselves at the foot of
the gallows.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, I forgot you,&rdquo; said the tyrant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You shall do that.&nbsp; Down with you.&nbsp; And you
conspire with him against me, do you, viper?&nbsp; There, that is
work fit for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me
beside Joseph, who steadily concluded his supplications, and then
rose, vowing he would set off for the Grange directly.&nbsp; Mr.
Linton was a magistrate, and though he had fifty wives dead, he
should inquire into this.&nbsp; He was so obstinate in his
resolution, that Heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel from my
lips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing over me,
heaving with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the account
in answer to his questions.&nbsp; It required a great deal of
labour to satisfy the old man that Heathcliff was not the
aggressor; especially with my hardly-wrung replies.&nbsp;
However, Mr. Earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive still;
Joseph hastened to administer a dose of spirits, and by their
succour his master presently regained motion and
consciousness.&nbsp; Heathcliff, aware that his opponent was
ignorant of the treatment received while insensible, called him
deliriously intoxicated; and said he should not notice his
atrocious conduct further, but advised him to get to bed.&nbsp;
To my joy, he left us, after giving this judicious counsel, and
Hindley stretched himself on the hearthstone.&nbsp; I departed to
my own room, marvelling that I had escaped so easily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This morning, when I came down, about half an hour
before noon, Mr. Earnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick;
his evil genius, almost as gaunt and ghastly, leant against the
chimney.&nbsp; Neither appeared inclined to dine, and, having
waited till all was cold on the table, I commenced alone.&nbsp;
Nothing hindered me from eating heartily, and I experienced a
certain sense of satisfaction and superiority, as, at intervals,
I cast a look towards my silent companions, and felt the comfort
of a quiet conscience within me.&nbsp; After I had done, I
ventured on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire, going
round Earnshaw&rsquo;s seat, and kneeling in the corner beside
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and
contemplated his features almost as confidently as if they had
been turned to stone.&nbsp; His forehead, that I once thought so
manly, and that I now think so diabolical, was shaded with a
heavy cloud; his basilisk eyes were nearly quenched by
sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, for the lashes were wet
then: his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer, and sealed in an
expression of unspeakable sadness.&nbsp; Had it been another, I
would have covered my face in the presence of such grief.&nbsp;
In <i>his</i> case, I was gratified; and, ignoble as it seems to
insult a fallen enemy, I couldn&rsquo;t miss this chance of
sticking in a dart: his weakness was the only time when I could
taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fie, fie, Miss!&rsquo; I interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;One
might suppose you had never opened a Bible in your life.&nbsp; If
God afflict your enemies, surely that ought to suffice you.&nbsp;
It is both mean and presumptuous to add your torture to
his!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In general I&rsquo;ll allow that it would be,
Ellen,&rsquo; she continued; &lsquo;but what misery laid on
Heathcliff could content me, unless I have a hand in it?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d rather he suffered less, if I might cause his
sufferings and he might <i>know</i> that I was the cause.&nbsp;
Oh, I owe him so much.&nbsp; On only one condition can I hope to
forgive him.&nbsp; It is, if I may take an eye for an eye, a
tooth for a tooth; for every wrench of agony return a wrench:
reduce him to my level.&nbsp; As he was the first to injure, make
him the first to implore pardon; and then&mdash;why then, Ellen,
I might show you some generosity.&nbsp; But it is utterly
impossible I can ever be revenged, and therefore I cannot forgive
him.&nbsp; Hindley wanted some water, and I handed him a glass,
and asked him how he was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Not as ill as I wish,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But leaving out my arm, every inch of me is as sore as if
I had been fighting with a legion of imps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, no wonder,&rdquo; was my next remark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Catherine used to boast that she stood between you and
bodily harm: she meant that certain persons would not hurt you
for fear of offending her.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s well people
don&rsquo;t <i>really</i> rise from their grave, or, last night,
she might have witnessed a repulsive scene!&nbsp; Are not you
bruised, and cut over your chest and shoulders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;but what do you mean?&nbsp; Did he dare to strike me when
I was down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He trampled on and kicked you, and dashed you on
the ground,&rdquo; I whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;And his mouth
watered to tear you with his teeth; because he&rsquo;s only half
man: not so much, and the rest fiend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of
our mutual foe; who, absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible
to anything around him: the longer he stood, the plainer his
reflections revealed their blackness through his features.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, if God would but give me strength to
strangle him in my last agony, I&rsquo;d go to hell with
joy,&rdquo; groaned the impatient man, writhing to rise, and
sinking back in despair, convinced of his inadequacy for the
struggle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Nay, it&rsquo;s enough that he has murdered one
of you,&rdquo; I observed aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;At the Grange,
every one knows your sister would have been living now had it not
been for Mr. Heathcliff.&nbsp; After all, it is preferable to be
hated than loved by him.&nbsp; When I recollect how happy we
were&mdash;how happy Catherine was before he came&mdash;I&rsquo;m
fit to curse the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what
was said, than the spirit of the person who said it.&nbsp; His
attention was roused, I saw, for his eyes rained down tears among
the ashes, and he drew his breath in suffocating sighs.&nbsp; I
stared full at him, and laughed scornfully.&nbsp; The clouded
windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which
usually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did
not fear to hazard another sound of derision.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Get up, and begone out of my sight,&rdquo; said
the mourner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I guessed he uttered those words, at least, though his
voice was hardly intelligible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I loved Catherine too; and her brother requires
attendance, which, for her sake, I shall supply.&nbsp; Now, that
she&rsquo;s dead, I see her in Hindley: Hindley has exactly her
eyes, if you had not tried to gouge them out, and made them black
and red; and her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Get up, wretched idiot, before I stamp you to
death!&rdquo; he cried, making a movement that caused me to make
one also.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; I continued, holding myself
ready to flee, &ldquo;if poor Catherine had trusted you, and
assumed the ridiculous, contemptible, degrading title of Mrs.
Heathcliff, she would soon have presented a similar
picture!&nbsp; <i>She</i> wouldn&rsquo;t have borne your
abominable behaviour quietly: her detestation and disgust must
have found voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The back of the settle and Earnshaw&rsquo;s person
interposed between me and him; so instead of endeavouring to
reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife from the table and flung it
at my head.&nbsp; It struck beneath my ear, and stopped the
sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to the
door and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper
than his missile.&nbsp; The last glimpse I caught of him was a
furious rush on his part, checked by the embrace of his host; and
both fell locked together on the hearth.&nbsp; In my flight
through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to his master; I knocked
over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies from a
chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from
purgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then,
quitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over
banks, and wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact,
towards the beacon-light of the Grange.&nbsp; And far rather
would I be condemned to a perpetual dwelling in the infernal
regions than, even for one night, abide beneath the roof of
Wuthering Heights again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she
rose, and bidding me put on her bonnet, and a great shawl I had
brought, and turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to
remain another hour, she stepped on to a chair, kissed
Edgar&rsquo;s and Catherine&rsquo;s portraits, bestowed a similar
salute on me, and descended to the carriage, accompanied by
Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress.&nbsp;
She was driven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but a
regular correspondence was established between her and my master
when things were more settled.&nbsp; I believe her new abode was
in the south, near London; there she had a son born a few months
subsequent to her escape.&nbsp; He was christened Linton, and,
from the first, she reported him to be an ailing, peevish
creature.</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired
where she lived.&nbsp; I refused to tell.&nbsp; He remarked that
it was not of any moment, only she must beware of coming to her
brother: she should not be with him, if he had to keep her
himself.&nbsp; Though I would give no information, he discovered,
through some of the other servants, both her place of residence
and the existence of the child.&nbsp; Still, he didn&rsquo;t
molest her: for which forbearance she might thank his aversion, I
suppose.&nbsp; He often asked about the infant, when he saw me;
and on hearing its name, smiled grimly, and observed: &lsquo;They
wish me to hate it too, do they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think they wish you to know anything
about it,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll have it,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;when I
want it.&nbsp; They may reckon on that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some
thirteen years after the decease of Catherine, when Linton was
twelve, or a little more.</p>
<p>On the day succeeding Isabella&rsquo;s unexpected visit I had
no opportunity of speaking to my master: he shunned conversation,
and was fit for discussing nothing.&nbsp; When I could get him to
listen, I saw it pleased him that his sister had left her
husband; whom he abhorred with an intensity which the mildness of
his nature would scarcely seem to allow.&nbsp; So deep and
sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from going anywhere
where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff.&nbsp; Grief,
and that together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he
threw up his office of magistrate, ceased even to attend church,
avoided the village on all occasions, and spent a life of entire
seclusion within the limits of his park and grounds; only varied
by solitary rambles on the moors, and visits to the grave of his
wife, mostly at evening, or early morning before other wanderers
were abroad.&nbsp; But he was too good to be thoroughly unhappy
long.&nbsp; <i>He</i> didn&rsquo;t pray for Catherine&rsquo;s
soul to haunt him.&nbsp; Time brought resignation, and a
melancholy sweeter than common joy.&nbsp; He recalled her memory
with ardent, tender love, and hopeful aspiring to the better
world; where he doubted not she was gone.</p>
<p>And he had earthly consolation and affections also.&nbsp; For
a few days, I said, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to
the departed: that coldness melted as fast as snow in April, and
ere the tiny thing could stammer a word or totter a step it
wielded a despot&rsquo;s sceptre in his heart.&nbsp; It was named
Catherine; but he never called it the name in full, as he had
never called the first Catherine short: probably because
Heathcliff had a habit of doing so.&nbsp; The little one was
always Cathy: it formed to him a distinction from the mother, and
yet a connection with her; and his attachment sprang from its
relation to her, far more than from its being his own.</p>
<p>I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw,
and perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct
was so opposite in similar circumstances.&nbsp; They had both
been fond husbands, and were both attached to their children; and
I could not see how they shouldn&rsquo;t both have taken the same
road, for good or evil.&nbsp; But, I thought in my mind, Hindley,
with apparently the stronger head, has shown himself sadly the
worse and the weaker man.&nbsp; When his ship struck, the captain
abandoned his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save her,
rushed into riot and confusion, leaving no hope for their
luckless vessel.&nbsp; Linton, on the contrary, displayed the
true courage of a loyal and faithful soul: he trusted God; and
God comforted him.&nbsp; One hoped, and the other despaired: they
chose their own lots, and were righteously doomed to endure
them.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll not want to hear my moralising, Mr.
Lockwood; you&rsquo;ll judge, as well as I can, all these things:
at least, you&rsquo;ll think you will, and that&rsquo;s the
same.&nbsp; The end of Earnshaw was what might have been
expected; it followed fast on his sister&rsquo;s: there were
scarcely six months between them.&nbsp; We, at the Grange, never
got a very succinct account of his state preceding it; all that I
did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the preparations for
the funeral.&nbsp; Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to my
master.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Nelly,&rsquo; said he, riding into the yard one
morning, too early not to alarm me with an instant presentiment
of bad news, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s yours and my turn to go into
mourning at present.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s given us the slip now, do
you think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo; I asked in a flurry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, guess!&rsquo; he returned, dismounting, and
slinging his bridle on a hook by the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;And nip
up the corner of your apron: I&rsquo;m certain you&rsquo;ll need
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?&rsquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! would you have tears for him?&rsquo; said the
doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, Heathcliff&rsquo;s a tough young fellow:
he looks blooming to-day.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve just seen him.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better
half.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?&rsquo; I repeated
impatiently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hindley Earnshaw!&nbsp; Your old friend Hindley,&rsquo;
he replied, &lsquo;and my wicked gossip: though he&rsquo;s been
too wild for me this long while.&nbsp; There!&nbsp; I said we
should draw water.&nbsp; But cheer up!&nbsp; He died true to his
character: drunk as a lord.&nbsp; Poor lad!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sorry, too.&nbsp; One can&rsquo;t help missing an old companion:
though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man imagined,
and has done me many a rascally turn.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s barely
twenty-seven, it seems; that&rsquo;s your own age: who would have
thought you were born in one year?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs.
Linton&rsquo;s death: ancient associations lingered round my
heart; I sat down in the porch and wept as for a blood relation,
desiring Mr. Kenneth to get another servant to introduce him to
the master.&nbsp; I could not hinder myself from pondering on the
question&mdash;&lsquo;Had he had fair play?&rsquo;&nbsp; Whatever
I did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely
pertinacious that I resolved on requesting leave to go to
Wuthering Heights, and assist in the last duties to the
dead.&nbsp; Mr. Linton was extremely reluctant to consent, but I
pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which he lay;
and I said my old master and foster-brother had a claim on my
services as strong as his own.&nbsp; Besides, I reminded him that
the child Hareton was his wife&rsquo;s nephew, and, in the
absence of nearer kin, he ought to act as its guardian; and he
ought to and must inquire how the property was left, and look
over the concerns of his brother-in-law.&nbsp; He was unfit for
attending to such matters then, but he bid me speak to his
lawyer; and at length permitted me to go.&nbsp; His lawyer had
been Earnshaw&rsquo;s also: I called at the village, and asked
him to accompany me.&nbsp; He shook his head, and advised that
Heathcliff should be let alone; affirming, if the truth were
known, Hareton would be found little else than a beggar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His father died in debt,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;the
whole property is mortgaged, and the sole chance for the natural
heir is to allow him an opportunity of creating some interest in
the creditor&rsquo;s heart, that he may be inclined to deal
leniently towards him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see
everything carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in
sufficient distress, expressed satisfaction at my presence.&nbsp;
Mr. Heathcliff said he did not perceive that I was wanted; but I
might stay and order the arrangements for the funeral, if I
chose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Correctly,&rsquo; he remarked, &lsquo;that fool&rsquo;s
body should be buried at the cross-roads, without ceremony of any
kind.&nbsp; I happened to leave him ten minutes yesterday
afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two doors of the
house against me, and he has spent the night in drinking himself
to death deliberately!&nbsp; We broke in this morning, for we
heard him sporting like a horse; and there he was, laid over the
settle: flaying and scalping would not have wakened him.&nbsp; I
sent for Kenneth, and he came; but not till the beast had changed
into carrion: he was both dead and cold, and stark; and so
you&rsquo;ll allow it was useless making more stir about
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d rayther he&rsquo;d goan hisseln for t&rsquo;
doctor!&nbsp; I sud ha&rsquo; taen tent o&rsquo; t&rsquo;
maister better nor him&mdash;and he warn&rsquo;t deead when I
left, naught o&rsquo; t&rsquo; soart!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I insisted on the funeral being respectable.&nbsp; Mr.
Heathcliff said I might have my own way there too: only, he
desired me to remember that the money for the whole affair came
out of his pocket.&nbsp; He maintained a hard, careless
deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if anything, it
expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work
successfully executed.&nbsp; I observed once, indeed, something
like exultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were
bearing the coffin from the house.&nbsp; He had the hypocrisy to
represent a mourner: and previous to following with Hareton, he
lifted the unfortunate child on to the table and muttered, with
peculiar gusto, &lsquo;Now, my bonny lad, you are
<i>mine</i>!&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ll see if one tree won&rsquo;t
grow as crooked as another, with the same wind to twist
it!&rsquo;&nbsp; The unsuspecting thing was pleased at this
speech: he played with Heathcliff&rsquo;s whiskers, and stroked
his cheek; but I divined its meaning, and observed tartly,
&lsquo;That boy must go back with me to Thrushcross Grange,
sir.&nbsp; There is nothing in the world less yours than he
is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does Linton say so?&rsquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course&mdash;he has ordered me to take him,&rsquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the scoundrel, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll not
argue the subject now: but I have a fancy to try my hand at
rearing a young one; so intimate to your master that I must
supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt to remove
it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but
I&rsquo;ll be pretty sure to make the other come!&nbsp; Remember
to tell him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This hint was enough to bind our hands.&nbsp; I repeated its
substance on my return; and Edgar Linton, little interested at
the commencement, spoke no more of interfering.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
not aware that he could have done it to any purpose, had he been
ever so willing.</p>
<p>The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held
firm possession, and proved to the attorney&mdash;who, in his
turn, proved it to Mr. Linton&mdash;that Earnshaw had mortgaged
every yard of land he owned for cash to supply his mania for
gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the mortgagee.&nbsp; In that
manner Hareton, who should now be the first gentleman in the
neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete dependence on
his father&rsquo;s inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house
as a servant, deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to
right himself, because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance
that he has been wronged.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p>The twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal
period were the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in
their passage rose from our little lady&rsquo;s trifling
illnesses, which she had to experience in common with all
children, rich and poor.&nbsp; For the rest, after the first six
months, she grew like a larch, and could walk and talk too, in
her own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over Mrs.
Linton&rsquo;s dust.&nbsp; She was the most winning thing that
ever brought sunshine into a desolate house: a real beauty in
face, with the Earnshaws&rsquo; handsome dark eyes, but the
Lintons&rsquo; fair skin and small features, and yellow curling
hair.&nbsp; Her spirit was high, though not rough, and qualified
by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its
affections.&nbsp; That capacity for intense attachments reminded
me of her mother: still she did not resemble her: for she could
be soft and mild as a dove, and she had a gentle voice and
pensive expression: her anger was never furious; her love never
fierce: it was deep and tender.&nbsp; However, it must be
acknowledged, she had faults to foil her gifts.&nbsp; A
propensity to be saucy was one; and a perverse will, that
indulged children invariably acquire, whether they be good
tempered or cross.&nbsp; If a servant chanced to vex her, it was
always&mdash;&lsquo;I shall tell papa!&rsquo;&nbsp; And if he
reproved her, even by a look, you would have thought it a
heart-breaking business: I don&rsquo;t believe he ever did speak
a harsh word to her.&nbsp; He took her education entirely on
himself, and made it an amusement.&nbsp; Fortunately, curiosity
and a quick intellect made her an apt scholar: she learned
rapidly and eagerly, and did honour to his teaching.</p>
<p>Till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been
beyond the range of the park by herself.&nbsp; Mr. Linton would
take her with him a mile or so outside, on rare occasions; but he
trusted her to no one else.&nbsp; Gimmerton was an unsubstantial
name in her ears; the chapel, the only building she had
approached or entered, except her own home.&nbsp; Wuthering
Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a
perfect recluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented.&nbsp;
Sometimes, indeed, while surveying the country from her nursery
window, she would observe&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top
of those hills?&nbsp; I wonder what lies on the other
side&mdash;is it the sea?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Miss Cathy,&rsquo; I would answer; &lsquo;it is
hills again, just like these.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what are those golden rocks like when you stand
under them?&rsquo; she once asked.</p>
<p>The abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted
her notice; especially when the setting sun shone on it and the
topmost heights, and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in
shadow.&nbsp; I explained that they were bare masses of stone,
with hardly enough earth in their clefts to nourish a stunted
tree.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why are they bright so long after it is evening
here?&rsquo; she pursued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because they are a great deal higher up than we
are,&rsquo; replied I; &lsquo;you could not climb them, they are
too high and steep.&nbsp; In winter the frost is always there
before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have found snow
under that black hollow on the north-east side!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you have been on them!&rsquo; she cried
gleefully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then I can go, too, when I am a
woman.&nbsp; Has papa been, Ellen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa would tell you, Miss,&rsquo; I answered, hastily,
&lsquo;that they are not worth the trouble of visiting.&nbsp; The
moors, where you ramble with him, are much nicer; and Thrushcross
Park is the finest place in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I know the park, and I don&rsquo;t know
those,&rsquo; she murmured to herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I should
delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest point: my
little pony Minny shall take me some time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned her
head with a desire to fulfil this project: she teased Mr. Linton
about it; and he promised she should have the journey when she
got older.&nbsp; But Miss Catherine measured her age by months,
and, &lsquo;Now, am I old enough to go to Penistone Crags?&rsquo;
was the constant question in her mouth.&nbsp; The road thither
wound close by Wuthering Heights.&nbsp; Edgar had not the heart
to pass it; so she received as constantly the answer, &lsquo;Not
yet, love: not yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after
quitting her husband.&nbsp; Her family were of a delicate
constitution: she and Edgar both lacked the ruddy health that you
will generally meet in these parts.&nbsp; What her last illness
was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of the same thing,
a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but incurable, and
rapidly consuming life towards the close.&nbsp; She wrote to
inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a
four-months&rsquo; indisposition under which she had suffered,
and entreated him to come to her, if possible; for she had much
to settle, and she wished to bid him adieu, and deliver Linton
safely into his hands.&nbsp; Her hope was that Linton might be
left with him, as he had been with her: his father, she would
fain convince herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his
maintenance or education.&nbsp; My master hesitated not a moment
in complying with her request: reluctant as he was to leave home
at ordinary calls, he flew to answer this; commanding Catherine
to my peculiar vigilance, in his absence, with reiterated orders
that she must not wander out of the park, even under my escort he
did not calculate on her going unaccompanied.</p>
<p>He was away three weeks.&nbsp; The first day or two my charge
sat in a corner of the library, too sad for either reading or
playing: in that quiet state she caused me little trouble; but it
was succeeded by an interval of impatient, fretful weariness; and
being too busy, and too old then, to run up and down amusing her,
I hit on a method by which she might entertain herself.&nbsp; I
used to send her on her travels round the grounds&mdash;now on
foot, and now on a pony; indulging her with a patient audience of
all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.</p>
<p>The summer shone in full prime; and she took such a taste for
this solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out
from breakfast till tea; and then the evenings were spent in
recounting her fanciful tales.&nbsp; I did not fear her breaking
bounds; because the gates were generally locked, and I thought
she would scarcely venture forth alone, if they had stood wide
open.&nbsp; Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced.&nbsp;
Catherine came to me, one morning, at eight o&rsquo;clock, and
said she was that day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the
Desert with his caravan; and I must give her plenty of provision
for herself and beasts: a horse, and three camels, personated by
a large hound and a couple of pointers.&nbsp; I got together good
store of dainties, and slung them in a basket on one side of the
saddle; and she sprang up as gay as a fairy, sheltered by her
wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July sun, and trotted
off with a merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to avoid
galloping, and come back early.&nbsp; The naughty thing never
made her appearance at tea.&nbsp; One traveller, the hound, being
an old dog and fond of its ease, returned; but neither Cathy, nor
the pony, nor the two pointers were visible in any direction: I
despatched emissaries down this path, and that path, and at last
went wandering in search of her myself.&nbsp; There was a
labourer working at a fence round a plantation, on the borders of
the grounds.&nbsp; I inquired of him if he had seen our young
lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw her at morn,&rsquo; he replied: &lsquo;she would
have me to cut her a hazel switch, and then she leapt her
Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it is lowest, and galloped
out of sight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>You may guess how I felt at hearing this news.&nbsp; It struck
me directly she must have started for Penistone Crags.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What will become of her?&rsquo; I ejaculated, pushing
through a gap which the man was repairing, and making straight to
the high-road.&nbsp; I walked as if for a wager, mile after mile,
till a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no Catherine
could I detect, far or near.&nbsp; The Crags lie about a mile and
a half beyond Mr. Heathcliff&rsquo;s place, and that is four from
the Grange, so I began to fear night would fall ere I could reach
them.&nbsp; &lsquo;And what if she should have slipped in
clambering among them,&rsquo; I reflected, &lsquo;and been
killed, or broken some of her bones?&rsquo;&nbsp; My suspense was
truly painful; and, at first, it gave me delightful relief to
observe, in hurrying by the farmhouse, Charlie, the fiercest of
the pointers, lying under a window, with swelled head and
bleeding ear.&nbsp; I opened the wicket and ran to the door,
knocking vehemently for admittance.&nbsp; A woman whom I knew,
and who formerly lived at Gimmerton, answered: she had been
servant there since the death of Mr. Earnshaw.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;you are come a-seeking your
little mistress!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be frightened.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s here safe: but I&rsquo;m glad it isn&rsquo;t the
master.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not at home then, is he?&rsquo; I panted, quite
breathless with quick walking and alarm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; she replied: &lsquo;both he and Joseph
are off, and I think they won&rsquo;t return this hour or
more.&nbsp; Step in and rest you a bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth,
rocking herself in a little chair that had been her
mother&rsquo;s when a child.&nbsp; Her hat was hung against the
wall, and she seemed perfectly at home, laughing and chattering,
in the best spirits imaginable, to Hareton&mdash;now a great,
strong lad of eighteen&mdash;who stared at her with considerable
curiosity and astonishment: comprehending precious little of the
fluent succession of remarks and questions which her tongue never
ceased pouring forth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, Miss!&rsquo; I exclaimed, concealing my joy
under an angry countenance.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is your last ride,
till papa comes back.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not trust you over the
threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aha, Ellen!&rsquo; she cried, gaily, jumping up and
running to my side.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall have a pretty story to
tell to-night; and so you&rsquo;ve found me out.&nbsp; Have you
ever been here in your life before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put that hat on, and home at once,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m dreadfully grieved at you, Miss Cathy:
you&rsquo;ve done extremely wrong!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use
pouting and crying: that won&rsquo;t repay the trouble I&rsquo;ve
had, scouring the country after you.&nbsp; To think how Mr.
Linton charged me to keep you in; and you stealing off so!&nbsp;
It shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will put faith
in you any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have I done?&rsquo; sobbed she, instantly
checked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Papa charged me nothing: he&rsquo;ll not
scold me, Ellen&mdash;he&rsquo;s never cross, like
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come!&rsquo; I repeated.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
tie the riband.&nbsp; Now, let us have no petulance.&nbsp; Oh,
for shame!&nbsp; You thirteen years old, and such a
baby!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her
head, and retreating to the chimney out of my reach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said the servant, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be
hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean.&nbsp; We made her stop:
she&rsquo;d fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be
uneasy.&nbsp; Hareton offered to go with her, and I thought he
should: it&rsquo;s a wild road over the hills.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his
pockets, too awkward to speak; though he looked as if he did not
relish my intrusion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long am I to wait?&rsquo; I continued, disregarding
the woman&rsquo;s interference.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will be dark in
ten minutes.&nbsp; Where is the pony, Miss Cathy?&nbsp; And where
is Phoenix?&nbsp; I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so
please yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The pony is in the yard,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;and
Phoenix is shut in there.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s bitten&mdash;and so is
Charlie.&nbsp; I was going to tell you all about it; but you are
in a bad temper, and don&rsquo;t deserve to hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but
perceiving that the people of the house took her part, she
commenced capering round the room; and on my giving chase, ran
like a mouse over and under and behind the furniture, rendering
it ridiculous for me to pursue.&nbsp; Hareton and the woman
laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more impertinent still;
till I cried, in great irritation,&mdash;&lsquo;Well, Miss Cathy,
if you were aware whose house this is you&rsquo;d be glad enough
to get out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s <i>your</i> father&rsquo;s, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rsquo; said she, turning to Hareton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; he replied, looking down, and blushing
bashfully.</p>
<p>He could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they
were just his own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whose then&mdash;your master&rsquo;s?&rsquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>He coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an
oath, and turned away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is his master?&rsquo; continued the tiresome girl,
appealing to me.&nbsp; &lsquo;He talked about &ldquo;our
house,&rdquo; and &ldquo;our folk.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought he had
been the owner&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; And he never said Miss: he
should have done, shouldn&rsquo;t he, if he&rsquo;s a
servant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish
speech.&nbsp; I silently shook my questioner, and at last
succeeded in equipping her for departure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, get my horse,&rsquo; she said, addressing her
unknown kinsman as she would one of the stable-boys at the
Grange.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you may come with me.&nbsp; I want to
see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear about
the <i>fairishes</i>, as you call them: but make haste!&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; Get my horse, I say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see thee damned before I be <i>thy</i>
servant!&rsquo; growled the lad.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll see me <i>what</i>!&rsquo; asked Catherine
in surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damned&mdash;thou saucy witch!&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, Miss Cathy! you see you have got into pretty
company,&rsquo; I interposed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nice words to be used
to a young lady!&nbsp; Pray don&rsquo;t begin to dispute with
him.&nbsp; Come, let us seek for Minny ourselves, and
begone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Ellen,&rsquo; cried she, staring fixed in
astonishment, &lsquo;how dare he speak so to me?&nbsp;
Mustn&rsquo;t he be made to do as I ask him?&nbsp; You wicked
creature, I shall tell papa what you said.&mdash;Now,
then!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears
sprang into her eyes with indignation.&nbsp; &lsquo;You bring the
pony,&rsquo; she exclaimed, turning to the woman, &lsquo;and let
my dog free this moment!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Softly, Miss,&rsquo; answered she addressed;
&lsquo;you&rsquo;ll lose nothing by being civil.&nbsp; Though Mr.
Hareton, there, be not the master&rsquo;s son, he&rsquo;s your
cousin: and I was never hired to serve you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>He</i> my cousin!&rsquo; cried Cathy, with a
scornful laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed,&rsquo; responded her reprover.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Ellen! don&rsquo;t let them say such things,&rsquo;
she pursued in great trouble.&nbsp; &lsquo;Papa is gone to fetch
my cousin from London: my cousin is a gentleman&rsquo;s
son.&nbsp; That my&mdash;&rsquo; she stopped, and wept outright;
upset at the bare notion of relationship with such a clown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, hush!&rsquo; I whispered; &lsquo;people can have
many cousins and of all sorts, Miss Cathy, without being any the
worse for it; only they needn&rsquo;t keep their company, if they
be disagreeable and bad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not&mdash;he&rsquo;s not my cousin,
Ellen!&rsquo; she went on, gathering fresh grief from reflection,
and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the idea.</p>
<p>I was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual
revelations; having no doubt of Linton&rsquo;s approaching
arrival, communicated by the former, being reported to Mr.
Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that Catherine&rsquo;s first
thought on her father&rsquo;s return would be to seek an
explanation of the latter&rsquo;s assertion concerning her
rude-bred kindred.&nbsp; Hareton, recovering from his disgust at
being taken for a servant, seemed moved by her distress; and,
having fetched the pony round to the door, he took, to propitiate
her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp from the kennel, and
putting it into her hand, bid her whist! for he meant
nought.&nbsp; Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him with
a glance of awe and horror, then burst forth anew.</p>
<p>I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the
poor fellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in
features, and stout and healthy, but attired in garments
befitting his daily occupations of working on the farm and
lounging among the moors after rabbits and game.&nbsp; Still, I
thought I could detect in his physiognomy a mind owning better
qualities than his father ever possessed.&nbsp; Good things lost
amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far
over-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding,
evidence of a wealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops
under other and favourable circumstances.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff, I
believe, had not treated him physically ill; thanks to his
fearless nature, which offered no temptation to that course of
oppression: he had none of the timid susceptibility that would
have given zest to ill-treatment, in Heathcliff&rsquo;s
judgment.&nbsp; He appeared to have bent his malevolence on
making him a brute: he was never taught to read or write; never
rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper; never
led a single step towards virtue, or guarded by a single precept
against vice.&nbsp; And from what I heard, Joseph contributed
much to his deterioration, by a narrow-minded partiality which
prompted him to flatter and pet him, as a boy, because he was the
head of the old family.&nbsp; And as he had been in the habit of
accusing Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, when children, of
putting the master past his patience, and compelling him to seek
solace in drink by what he termed their &lsquo;offald
ways,&rsquo; so at present he laid the whole burden of
Hareton&rsquo;s faults on the shoulders of the usurper of his
property.&nbsp; If the lad swore, he wouldn&rsquo;t correct him:
nor however culpably he behaved.&nbsp; It gave Joseph
satisfaction, apparently, to watch him go the worst lengths: he
allowed that the lad was ruined: that his soul was abandoned to
perdition; but then he reflected that Heathcliff must answer for
it.&nbsp; Hareton&rsquo;s blood would be required at his hands;
and there lay immense consolation in that thought.&nbsp; Joseph
had instilled into him a pride of name, and of his lineage; he
would, had he dared, have fostered hate between him and the
present owner of the Heights: but his dread of that owner
amounted to superstition; and he confined his feelings regarding
him to muttered innuendoes and private comminations.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode of
living customary in those days at Wuthering Heights: I only speak
from hearsay; for I saw little.&nbsp; The villagers affirmed Mr.
Heathcliff was <i>near</i>, and a cruel hard landlord to his
tenants; but the house, inside, had regained its ancient aspect
of comfort under female management, and the scenes of riot common
in Hindley&rsquo;s time were not now enacted within its
walls.&nbsp; The master was too gloomy to seek companionship with
any people, good or bad; and he is yet.</p>
<p>This, however, is not making progress with my story.&nbsp;
Miss Cathy rejected the peace-offering of the terrier, and
demanded her own dogs, Charlie and Phoenix.&nbsp; They came
limping and hanging their heads; and we set out for home, sadly
out of sorts, every one of us.&nbsp; I could not wring from my
little lady how she had spent the day; except that, as I
supposed, the goal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she
arrived without adventure to the gate of the farm-house, when
Hareton happened to issue forth, attended by some canine
followers, who attacked her train.&nbsp; They had a smart battle,
before their owners could separate them: that formed an
introduction.&nbsp; Catherine told Hareton who she was, and where
she was going; and asked him to show her the way: finally,
beguiling him to accompany her.&nbsp; He opened the mysteries of
the Fairy Cave, and twenty other queer places.&nbsp; But, being
in disgrace, I was not favoured with a description of the
interesting objects she saw.&nbsp; I could gather, however, that
her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by
addressing him as a servant; and Heathcliff&rsquo;s housekeeper
hurt hers by calling him her cousin.&nbsp; Then the language he
had held to her rankled in her heart; she who was always
&lsquo;love,&rsquo; and &lsquo;darling,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;queen,&rsquo; and &lsquo;angel,&rsquo; with everybody at
the Grange, to be insulted so shockingly by a stranger!&nbsp; She
did not comprehend it; and hard work I had to obtain a promise
that she would not lay the grievance before her father.&nbsp; I
explained how he objected to the whole household at the Heights,
and how sorry he would be to find she had been there; but I
insisted most on the fact, that if she revealed my negligence of
his orders, he would perhaps be so angry that I should have to
leave; and Cathy couldn&rsquo;t bear that prospect: she pledged
her word, and kept it for my sake.&nbsp; After all, she was a
sweet little girl.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p>A letter, edged with black, announced the day of my
master&rsquo;s return. Isabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me
get mourning for his daughter, and arrange a room, and other
accommodations, for his youthful nephew.&nbsp; Catherine ran wild
with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back; and indulged
most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of
her &lsquo;real&rsquo; cousin.&nbsp; The evening of their
expected arrival came.&nbsp; Since early morning she had been
busy ordering her own small affairs; and now attired in her new
black frock&mdash;poor thing! her aunt&rsquo;s death impressed
her with no definite sorrow&mdash;she obliged me, by constant
worrying, to walk with her down through the grounds to meet
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Linton is just six months younger than I am,&rsquo; she
chattered, as we strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows
of mossy turf, under shadow of the trees.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
delightful it will be to have him for a playfellow!&nbsp; Aunt
Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it was lighter
than mine&mdash;more flaxen, and quite as fine.&nbsp; I have it
carefully preserved in a little glass box; and I&rsquo;ve often
thought what a pleasure it would be to see its owner.&nbsp; Oh! I
am happy&mdash;and papa, dear, dear papa!&nbsp; Come, Ellen, let
us run! come, run.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my
sober footsteps reached the gate, and then she seated herself on
the grassy bank beside the path, and tried to wait patiently; but
that was impossible: she couldn&rsquo;t be still a minute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long they are!&rsquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah, I see, some dust on the road&mdash;they are
coming!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; When will they be here?&nbsp; May we not
go a little way&mdash;half a mile, Ellen, only just half a
mile?&nbsp; Do say Yes: to that clump of birches at the
turn!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I refused staunchly.&nbsp; At length her suspense was ended:
the travelling carriage rolled in sight.&nbsp; Miss Cathy
shrieked and stretched out her arms as soon as she caught her
father&rsquo;s face looking from the window.&nbsp; He descended,
nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval elapsed
ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves.&nbsp;
While they exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after
Linton.&nbsp; He was asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm,
fur-lined cloak, as if it had been winter.&nbsp; A pale,
delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been taken for my
master&rsquo;s younger brother, so strong was the resemblance:
but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar
Linton never had.&nbsp; The latter saw me looking; and having
shaken hands, advised me to close the door, and leave him
undisturbed; for the journey had fatigued him.&nbsp; Cathy would
fain have taken one glance, but her father told her to come, and
they walked together up the park, while I hastened before to
prepare the servants.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, darling,&rsquo; said Mr. Linton, addressing his
daughter, as they halted at the bottom of the front steps:
&lsquo;your cousin is not so strong or so merry as you are, and
he has lost his mother, remember, a very short time since;
therefore, don&rsquo;t expect him to play and run about with you
directly.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t harass him much by talking: let
him be quiet this evening, at least, will you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, papa,&rsquo; answered Catherine: &lsquo;but I
do want to see him; and he hasn&rsquo;t once looked
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted
to the ground by his uncle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,&rsquo; he said,
putting their little hands together.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s
fond of you already; and mind you don&rsquo;t grieve her by
crying to-night.&nbsp; Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is
at an end, and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself
as you please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me go to bed, then,&rsquo; answered the boy,
shrinking from Catherine&rsquo;s salute; and he put his fingers
to remove incipient tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come, there&rsquo;s a good child,&rsquo; I
whispered, leading him in.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll make her
weep too&mdash;see how sorry she is for you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin
put on as sad a countenance as himself, and returned to her
father.&nbsp; All three entered, and mounted to the library,
where tea was laid ready.&nbsp; I proceeded to remove
Linton&rsquo;s cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair by the
table; but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry
afresh.&nbsp; My master inquired what was the matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t sit on a chair,&rsquo; sobbed the
boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some
tea,&rsquo; answered his uncle patiently.</p>
<p>He had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt
convinced, by his fretful ailing charge.&nbsp; Linton slowly
trailed himself off, and lay down.&nbsp; Cathy carried a
footstool and her cup to his side.&nbsp; At first she sat silent;
but that could not last: she had resolved to make a pet of her
little cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced
stroking his curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea
in her saucer, like a baby.&nbsp; This pleased him, for he was
not much better: he dried his eyes, and lightened into a faint
smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll do very well,&rsquo; said the master to
me, after watching them a minute.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well, if we
can keep him, Ellen.&nbsp; The company of a child of his own age
will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for strength
he&rsquo;ll gain it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, if we can keep him!&rsquo; I mused to myself; and
sore misgivings came over me that there was slight hope of
that.&nbsp; And then, I thought, how ever will that weakling live
at Wuthering Heights?&nbsp; Between his father and Hareton, what
playmates and instructors they&rsquo;ll be.&nbsp; Our doubts were
presently decided&mdash;even earlier than I expected.&nbsp; I had
just taken the children up-stairs, after tea was finished, and
seen Linton asleep&mdash;he would not suffer me to leave him till
that was the case&mdash;I had come down, and was standing by the
table in the hall, lighting a bedroom candle for Mr. Edgar, when
a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that Mr.
Heathcliff&rsquo;s servant Joseph was at the door, and wished to
speak with the master.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall ask him what he wants first,&rsquo; I said, in
considerable trepidation.&nbsp; &lsquo;A very unlikely hour to be
troubling people, and the instant they have returned from a long
journey.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think the master can see
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these
words, and now presented himself in the hall.&nbsp; He was donned
in his Sunday garments, with his most sanctimonious and sourest
face, and, holding his hat in one hand, and his stick in the
other, he proceeded to clean his shoes on the mat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-evening, Joseph,&rsquo; I said, coldly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What business brings you here to-night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s Maister Linton I mun spake to,&rsquo; he
answered, waving me disdainfully aside.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something
particular to say, I&rsquo;m sure he won&rsquo;t hear it
now,&rsquo; I continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;You had better sit down in
there, and entrust your message to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which is his rahm?&rsquo; pursued the fellow, surveying
the range of closed doors.</p>
<p>I perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very
reluctantly I went up to the library, and announced the
unseasonable visitor, advising that he should be dismissed till
next day.&nbsp; Mr. Linton had no time to empower me to do so,
for Joseph mounted close at my heels, and, pushing into the
apartment, planted himself at the far side of the table, with his
two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began in an
elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hathecliff has sent me for his lad, and I munn&rsquo;t
goa back &lsquo;bout him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Edgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding
sorrow overcast his features: he would have pitied the child on
his own account; but, recalling Isabella&rsquo;s hopes and fears,
and anxious wishes for her son, and her commendations of him to
his care, he grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up,
and searched in his heart how it might be avoided.&nbsp; No plan
offered itself: the very exhibition of any desire to keep him
would have rendered the claimant more peremptory: there was
nothing left but to resign him.&nbsp; However, he was not going
to rouse him from his sleep.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell Mr. Heathcliff,&rsquo; he answered calmly,
&lsquo;that his son shall come to Wuthering Heights
to-morrow.&nbsp; He is in bed, and too tired to go the distance
now.&nbsp; You may also tell him that the mother of Linton
desired him to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his
health is very precarious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Noa!&rsquo; said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on
the floor, and assuming an authoritative air.&nbsp; &lsquo;Noa!
that means naught.&nbsp; Hathecliff maks noa &lsquo;count
o&rsquo; t&rsquo; mother, nor ye norther; but he&rsquo;ll
heu&rsquo; his lad; und I mun tak&rsquo; him&mdash;soa now ye
knaw!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall not to-night!&rsquo; answered Linton
decisively.&nbsp; &lsquo;Walk down stairs at once, and repeat to
your master what I have said.&nbsp; Ellen, show him down.&nbsp;
Go&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid
the room of him and closed the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Varrah weell!&rsquo; shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew
off.&nbsp; &lsquo;To-morn, he&rsquo;s come hisseln, and thrust
<i>him</i> out, if ye darr!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p>To obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr.
Linton commissioned me to take the boy home early, on
Catherine&rsquo;s pony; and, said he&mdash;&lsquo;As we shall now
have no influence over his destiny, good or bad, you must say
nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she cannot associate
with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain in
ignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and
anxious to visit the Heights.&nbsp; Merely tell her his father
sent for him suddenly, and he has been obliged to leave
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five
o&rsquo;clock, and astonished to be informed that he must prepare
for further travelling; but I softened off the matter by stating
that he was going to spend some time with his father, Mr.
Heathcliff, who wished to see him so much, he did not like to
defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late
journey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father!&rsquo; he cried, in strange
perplexity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mamma never told me I had a
father.&nbsp; Where does he live?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather stay
with uncle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He lives a little distance from the Grange,&rsquo; I
replied; &lsquo;just beyond those hills: not so far, but you may
walk over here when you get hearty.&nbsp; And you should be glad
to go home, and to see him.&nbsp; You must try to love him, as
you did your mother, and then he will love you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why have I not heard of him before?&rsquo; asked
Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t mamma and he live together,
as other people do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He had business to keep him in the north,&rsquo; I
answered, &lsquo;and your mother&rsquo;s health required her to
reside in the south.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why didn&rsquo;t mamma speak to me about
him?&rsquo; persevered the child.&nbsp; &lsquo;She often talked
of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago.&nbsp; How am I to
love papa?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, all children love their parents,&rsquo; I
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your mother, perhaps, thought you would want
to be with him if she mentioned him often to you.&nbsp; Let us
make haste.&nbsp; An early ride on such a beautiful morning is
much preferable to an hour&rsquo;s more sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is <i>she</i> to go with us,&rsquo; he demanded,
&lsquo;the little girl I saw yesterday?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not now,&rsquo; replied I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is uncle?&rsquo; he continued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I shall be your companion there,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>Linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown
study.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t go without uncle,&rsquo; he cried at
length: &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell where you mean to take
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing
reluctance to meet his father; still he obstinately resisted any
progress towards dressing, and I had to call for my
master&rsquo;s assistance in coaxing him out of bed.&nbsp; The
poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive assurances
that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy would
visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I
invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way.&nbsp;
The pure heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle
canter of Minny, relieved his despondency after a while.&nbsp; He
began to put questions concerning his new home, and its
inhabitants, with greater interest and liveliness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross
Grange?&rsquo; he inquired, turning to take a last glance into
the valley, whence a light mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud
on the skirts of the blue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not so buried in trees,&rsquo; I replied,
&lsquo;and it is not quite so large, but you can see the country
beautifully all round; and the air is healthier for
you&mdash;fresher and drier.&nbsp; You will, perhaps, think the
building old and dark at first; though it is a respectable house:
the next best in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; And you will have such
nice rambles on the moors.&nbsp; Hareton Earnshaw&mdash;that is,
Miss Cathy&rsquo;s other cousin, and so yours in a
manner&mdash;will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can
bring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study;
and, now and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does,
frequently, walk out on the hills.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what is my father like?&rsquo; he asked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Is he as young and handsome as uncle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s as young,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;but he has
black hair and eyes, and looks sterner; and he is taller and
bigger altogether.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll not seem to you so gentle
and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still,
mind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally
he&rsquo;ll be fonder of you than any uncle, for you are his
own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Black hair and eyes!&rsquo; mused Linton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t fancy him.&nbsp; Then I am not like him, am
I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not much,&rsquo; I answered: not a morsel, I thought,
surveying with regret the white complexion and slim frame of my
companion, and his large languid eyes&mdash;his mother&rsquo;s
eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness kindled them a
moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How strange that he should never come to see mamma and
me!&rsquo; he murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;Has he ever seen me?&nbsp;
If he has, I must have been a baby.&nbsp; I remember not a single
thing about him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Master Linton,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;three hundred
miles is a great distance; and ten years seem very different in
length to a grown-up person compared with what they do to
you.&nbsp; It is probable Mr. Heathcliff proposed going from
summer to summer, but never found a convenient opportunity; and
now it is too late.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t trouble him with questions
on the subject: it will disturb him, for no good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the
remainder of the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse
garden-gate.&nbsp; I watched to catch his impressions in his
countenance.&nbsp; He surveyed the carved front and low-browed
lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and crooked firs, with
solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his private feelings
entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.&nbsp; But
he had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation
within.&nbsp; Before he dismounted, I went and opened the
door.&nbsp; It was half-past six; the family had just finished
breakfast: the servant was clearing and wiping down the
table.&nbsp; Joseph stood by his master&rsquo;s chair telling
some tale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing for
the hayfield.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hallo, Nelly!&rsquo; said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;I feared I should have to come down and fetch my
property myself.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve brought it, have you?&nbsp;
Let us see what we can make of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed
in gaping curiosity.&nbsp; Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over
the faces of the three.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sure-ly,&rsquo; said Joseph after a grave inspection,
&lsquo;he&rsquo;s swopped wi&rsquo; ye, Maister, an&rsquo;
yon&rsquo;s his lass!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion,
uttered a scornful laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming
thing!&rsquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t they
reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly?&nbsp; Oh, damn my soul!
but that&rsquo;s worse than I expected&mdash;and the devil knows
I was not sanguine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and
enter.&nbsp; He did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his
father&rsquo;s speech, or whether it were intended for him:
indeed, he was not yet certain that the grim, sneering stranger
was his father.&nbsp; But he clung to me with growing
trepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff&rsquo;s taking a seat and
bidding him &lsquo;come hither&rsquo; he hid his face on my
shoulder and wept.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tut, tut!&rsquo; said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand
and dragging him roughly between his knees, and then holding up
his head by the chin.&nbsp; &lsquo;None of that nonsense!&nbsp;
We&rsquo;re not going to hurt thee, Linton&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that
thy name?&nbsp; Thou art thy mother&rsquo;s child,
entirely!&nbsp; Where is my share in thee, puling
chicken?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took off the boy&rsquo;s cap and pushed back his thick
flaxen curls, felt his slender arms and his small fingers; during
which examination Linton ceased crying, and lifted his great blue
eyes to inspect the inspector.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know me?&rsquo; asked Heathcliff, having
satisfied himself that the limbs were all equally frail and
feeble.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of me, I daresay?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he replied again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&nbsp; What a shame of your mother, never to waken
your filial regard for me!&nbsp; You are my son, then, I&rsquo;ll
tell you; and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in
ignorance of the sort of father you possessed.&nbsp; Now,
don&rsquo;t wince, and colour up!&nbsp; Though it is something to
see you have not white blood.&nbsp; Be a good lad; and I&rsquo;ll
do for you.&nbsp; Nelly, if you be tired you may sit down; if
not, get home again.&nbsp; I guess you&rsquo;ll report what you
hear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this thing
won&rsquo;t be settled while you linger about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied I, &lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll be
kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or you&rsquo;ll not keep him
long; and he&rsquo;s all you have akin in the wide world, that
you will ever know&mdash;remember.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be very kind to him, you needn&rsquo;t
fear,&rsquo; he said, laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only nobody else
must be kind to him: I&rsquo;m jealous of monopolising his
affection.&nbsp; And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad
some breakfast.&nbsp; Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your
work.&nbsp; Yes, Nell,&rsquo; he added, when they had departed,
&lsquo;my son is prospective owner of your place, and I should
not wish him to die till I was certain of being his
successor.&nbsp; Besides, he&rsquo;s <i>mine</i>, and I want the
triumph of seeing <i>my</i> descendant fairly lord of their
estates; my child hiring their children to till their
fathers&rsquo; lands for wages.&nbsp; That is the sole
consideration which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him
for himself, and hate him for the memories he revives!&nbsp; But
that consideration is sufficient: he&rsquo;s as safe with me, and
shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own.&nbsp;
I have a room up-stairs, furnished for him in handsome style;
I&rsquo;ve engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week,
from twenty miles&rsquo; distance, to teach him what he pleases
to learn.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve ordered Hareton to obey him: and in
fact I&rsquo;ve arranged everything with a view to preserve the
superior and the gentleman in him, above his associates.&nbsp; I
do regret, however, that he so little deserves the trouble: if I
wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a worthy
object of pride; and I&rsquo;m bitterly disappointed with the
whey-faced, whining wretch!&rsquo;</p>
<p>While he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of
milk-porridge, and placed it before Linton: who stirred round the
homely mess with a look of aversion, and affirmed he could not
eat it.&nbsp; I saw the old man-servant shared largely in his
master&rsquo;s scorn of the child; though he was compelled to
retain the sentiment in his heart, because Heathcliff plainly
meant his underlings to hold him in honour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cannot ate it?&rsquo; repeated he, peering in
Linton&rsquo;s face, and subduing his voice to a whisper, for
fear of being overheard.&nbsp; &lsquo;But Maister Hareton nivir
ate naught else, when he wer a little &rsquo;un; and what wer
gooid enough for him&rsquo;s gooid enough for ye, I&rsquo;s
rayther think!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I <i>sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> eat it!&rsquo; answered
Linton, snappishly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take it away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to
us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there aught ails th&rsquo; victuals?&rsquo; he
asked, thrusting the tray under Heathcliff&rsquo;s nose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What should ail them?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wah!&rsquo; answered Joseph, &lsquo;yon dainty chap
says he cannut ate &rsquo;em.&nbsp; But I guess it&rsquo;s
raight!&nbsp; His mother wer just soa&mdash;we wer a&rsquo;most
too mucky to sow t&rsquo; corn for makking her breead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mention his mother to me,&rsquo; said the
master, angrily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get him something that he can eat,
that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; What is his usual food, Nelly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received
instructions to prepare some.&nbsp; Come, I reflected, his
father&rsquo;s selfishness may contribute to his comfort.&nbsp;
He perceives his delicate constitution, and the necessity of
treating him tolerably.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll console Mr. Edgar by
acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff&rsquo;s humour has
taken.&nbsp; Having no excuse for lingering longer, I slipped
out, while Linton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances
of a friendly sheep-dog.&nbsp; But he was too much on the alert
to be cheated: as I closed the door, I heard a cry, and a frantic
repetition of the words&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not stay
here!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not stay here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to
come forth.&nbsp; I mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and
so my brief guardianship ended.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p>We had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high
glee, eager to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and
lamentations followed the news of his departure that Edgar
himself was obliged to soothe her, by affirming he should come
back soon: he added, however, &lsquo;if I can get him&rsquo;; and
there were no hopes of that.&nbsp; This promise poorly pacified
her; but time was more potent; and though still at intervals she
inquired of her father when Linton would return, before she did
see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that
she did not recognise him.</p>
<p>When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering
Heights, in paying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask
how the young master got on; for he lived almost as secluded as
Catherine herself, and was never to be seen.&nbsp; I could gather
from her that he continued in weak health, and was a tiresome
inmate.&nbsp; She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to dislike him ever
longer and worse, though he took some trouble to conceal it: he
had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could not do at
all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes
together.&nbsp; There seldom passed much talk between them:
Linton learnt his lessons and spent his evenings in a small
apartment they called the parlour: or else lay in bed all day:
for he was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and aches, and
pains of some sort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I never know such a fainthearted creature,&rsquo;
added the woman; &lsquo;nor one so careful of hisseln.&nbsp; He
<i>will</i> go on, if I leave the window open a bit late in the
evening.&nbsp; Oh! it&rsquo;s killing, a breath of night
air!&nbsp; And he must have a fire in the middle of summer; and
Joseph&rsquo;s bacca-pipe is poison; and he must always have
sweets and dainties, and always milk, milk for ever&mdash;heeding
naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter; and there
he&rsquo;ll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the
fire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip
at; and if Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him&mdash;Hareton is
not bad-natured, though he&rsquo;s rough&mdash;they&rsquo;re sure
to part, one swearing and the other crying.&nbsp; I believe the
master would relish Earnshaw&rsquo;s thrashing him to a mummy, if
he were not his son; and I&rsquo;m certain he would be fit to
turn him out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives
hisseln.&nbsp; But then he won&rsquo;t go into danger of
temptation: he never enters the parlour, and should Linton show
those ways in the house where he is, he sends him up-stairs
directly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had
rendered young Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were
not so originally; and my interest in him, consequently, decayed:
though still I was moved with a sense of grief at his lot, and a
wish that he had been left with us.&nbsp; Mr. Edgar encouraged me
to gain information: he thought a great deal about him, I fancy,
and would have run some risk to see him; and he told me once to
ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village?&nbsp;
She said he had only been twice, on horseback, accompanying his
father; and both times he pretended to be quite knocked up for
three or four days afterwards.&nbsp; That housekeeper left, if I
recollect rightly, two years after he came; and another, whom I
did not know, was her successor; she lives there still.</p>
<p>Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till
Miss Cathy reached sixteen.&nbsp; On the anniversary of her birth
we never manifested any signs of rejoicing, because it was also
the anniversary of my late mistress&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Her
father invariably spent that day alone in the library; and
walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he would
frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight.&nbsp; Therefore
Catherine was thrown on her own resources for amusement.&nbsp;
This twentieth of March was a beautiful spring day, and when her
father had retired, my young lady came down dressed for going
out, and said she asked to have a ramble on the edge of the moor
with me: Mr. Linton had given her leave, if we went only a short
distance and were back within the hour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So make haste, Ellen!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
know where I wish to go; where a colony of moor-game are settled:
I want to see whether they have made their nests yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That must be a good distance up,&rsquo; I answered;
&lsquo;they don&rsquo;t breed on the edge of the moor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s not,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve gone very near with papa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of
the matter.&nbsp; She bounded before me, and returned to my side,
and was off again like a young greyhound; and, at first, I found
plenty of entertainment in listening to the larks singing far and
near, and enjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and watching her, my
pet and my delight, with her golden ringlets flying loose behind,
and her bright cheek, as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild
rose, and her eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure.&nbsp; She was
a happy creature, and an angel, in those days.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
pity she could not be content.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;where are your moor-game,
Miss Cathy?&nbsp; We should be at them: the Grange park-fence is
a great way off now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, a little further&mdash;only a little further,
Ellen,&rsquo; was her answer, continually.&nbsp; &lsquo;Climb to
that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time you reach the other
side I shall have raised the birds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass,
that, at length, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt,
and retrace our steps.&nbsp; I shouted to her, as she had
outstripped me a long way; she either did not hear or did not
regard, for she still sprang on, and I was compelled to
follow.&nbsp; Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I came
in sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights
than her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her,
one of whom I felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.</p>
<p>Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least,
hunting out the nests of the grouse.&nbsp; The Heights were
Heathcliff&rsquo;s land, and he was reproving the poacher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve neither taken any nor found any,&rsquo; she
said, as I toiled to them, expanding her hands in corroboration
of the statement.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to take them;
but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I wished to
see the eggs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing
his acquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his
malevolence towards it, and demanded who &lsquo;papa&rsquo;
was?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,&rsquo; she
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought you did not know me, or you
wouldn&rsquo;t have spoken in that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected,
then?&rsquo; he said, sarcastically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what are you?&rsquo; inquired Catherine, gazing
curiously on the speaker.&nbsp; &lsquo;That man I&rsquo;ve seen
before.&nbsp; Is he your son?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained
nothing but increased bu
